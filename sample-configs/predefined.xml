                    <description>Facebook (branded as "facebook") is a social networking website launched on February 4, 2004. The free-access website is privately owned and operated by Facebook, Inc. Users can join networks organized by city , workplace, school, and region to connect and interact with other people. People can also add friends and send them messages, and update their personal profile to notify friends about themselves. The website's name refers to the paper facebooks depicting members of a campus community that some American colleges and prepatory schools give to incoming students, faculty, and staff as a way to get to know other people on campus. Features include a Wall for posting messages and Photos for uploading digital photos. The website has more than 80 million active users worldwide.

Facebook has met with some controversy over the past few years. It has been blocked in several countries including Syria and Iran. Privacy has also been an issue, and it has been compromised several times.

It was released on April 1, 2004 as a private beta release by invitation only and was opened to all as a public beta on February 7, 2007. With an initial storage capacity of 1 GB, it drastically increased the standard for free storage.

Gmail currently offers over 6000 MB of free storage (increasing by approximately 3.348 MB every day), with an additional 10 GB available for US$20 per year. It has a search-oriented interface and a unique 'conversation view' similar to an internet forum or the iPhone Text messaging application. Gmail is well-known for its use of the Ajax programming technique in its design, and has tens of millions of users. </description>

The following day, existing users were allowed to invite friends to the service to create their own accounts. However, this was quickly suspended in a day after there was insane demand for accounts.

Google+ will be built as a layer that not only integrates different Google social services, such as Google Profiles and Google Buzz, but also introduces many new features including Circles, Hangouts, Sparks and Huddles. Google+ will also be available as a Desktop application and as an application on Android and iOS.</description>

                <entry id="87" name="google-translate">
                    <description>Google Translate is a service provided by Google Inc. to translate a section of text, or a webpage, into another language. The service limits the number of paragraphs, or range of technical terms, that will be translated. It is also possible to enter searches in a source language that are first translated to a destination language allowing you to browse and interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language. For some languages, users are asked for alternate translations such as for technical terms, to be included for future updates to the translation process. Text in a foreign language can be typed, and if "Detect Language" is selected, it will not only detect the language, but it will translate into English by default.

Unlike other translation services such as Babel Fish, AOL, and Yahoo which use SYSTRAN, Google uses its own translation software. Some say that this could lead to a revolution in modern language industry. 

Google Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. While it can help the reader to understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations. Some languages produce better results than others. 

It does not apply grammatical rules, since its algorithms are based on statistical analysis rather than traditional rule-based analysis.

Languages written in Devanagari or the Arabic script and its variants can be transliterated automatically from phonetic equivalents written in the Latin alphabet.</description>

The site was launched by Raymond Spanjar, Koen Kam and Floris Rost van Tonningen. The name Hyves comes from the English Beehive - not from Hives, hereby comparing the users to bees in a hyve. Since the domain hives.nl was already registered, they chose to call their website Hyves.
The focus of this website is on keeping in touch with existing friends and making new friends. There is no need to have knowledge of HTML for creating a Hyve. It is comparable with other social networking sites. Users can create personalized pages of themselves with rich media content, such as photos, videos, flash content and custom layouts.</description>

                    <description>iTunes is a digital media player application, introduced by Apple Inc. on January 9, 2001, at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco. The application is used for playing and organizing digital music and video files. The program is also an interface to manage the contents on Apple popular iPod digital media players as well as the iPhone. Additionally, iTunes can connect to the iTunes Store via the Internet to purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, iPod games, audiobooks, various podcasts, feature length films and Movie Rentals (available only in the USA, UK,Canada, Australia and New Zealand), and Ringtones (available only in the USA). Since July 11, 2008, there has also been the option to download apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch as long as they are running the 2.0 firmware released on the same date.

iTunes is available as a free download for Mac OS X, Windows Vista, and Windows XP from Apples website. It is also bundled with all Macs, and some HP and Dell computers. Older versions are available for Mac OS 9, OS X 10.0-10.2, and Windows 2000. Although Apple does not produce iTunes for other operating systems, it can, however, be run on Linux-based operating systems through Wine, a Windows compatibility layer.

A version of iTunes shipped with cell phones from Motorola, which included the ability to sync music from an iTunes library to the cellphone, as well as a similar interface between both platforms. Since the release of the iPhone, Apple has stopped distributing iTunes with other manufacturers phones in order to concentrate sales to Apples device.  </description>

Kaixin001's success can be partly credited to the Great Firewall of China. Due to the permanent blockage of other Social Networking Websites, such as Myspace, Facebook and Twitter since the summer of 2009, after the UrUmqi riots, many Chinese nationals turned to domestic sites, hence the membership spikes.</description>

It can be used to host web sites, termed SharePoint Portals, which can be used to access shared workspaces and documents, as well as specialized applications such as wikis and blogs, from within a browser. SharePoint functionality is exposed as web parts, which are components that implement a certain functionality, such as a task list, or discussion pane. These web parts are then composed into web pages, which are then hosted in the SharePoint portal. SharePoint sites are actually ASP.NET applications, which are served using IIS and use a SQL Server database as data storage backend.</description>

                    <description>text-based posts of up to 140 characters displayed on the author's profile page and delivered to the author's subscribers who are known as followers. Senders can restrict delivery to those in their circle of friends or, by default, allow open access. Users can send and receive tweets via the Twitter website, Short Message Service (SMS) or external applications. While the service itself costs nothing to use, accessing it through SMS may incur phone service provider fees.

The 140 character limit on message length was initially set for compatibility with SMS messaging, and has brought to the web the kind of shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140 character limit has also spurred the usage of URL shortening services such as tinyurl, bit.ly and tr.im, and content hosting services, such as Twitpic and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters.

Since its creation in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Twitter has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It is sometimes described as the "SMS of the Internet" since the use of Twitter's application programming interface for sending and receiving short text messages by other applications often eclipses the direct use of Twitter.

What we have to do is deliver to people the best and freshest most relevant information possible. We think of Twitter as it's not a social network, but it's an information network. It tells people what they care about as it is happening in the world.
Twitter is ranked as one of the 50 most popular websites worldwide by Alexa's web traffic analysis. Although estimates of the number of daily users vary because the company does not release the number of active accounts, a February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. In March 2009, a Nielsen.com blog ranked Twitter as the fastest-growing site in the Member Communities category for February 2009. Twitter had a monthly growth of 1,382 percent, Zimbio of 240 percent, followed by Facebook with an increase of 228 percent. However, only 40 percent of Twitter's users are retained.</description>

                    <description>The Access Grid is an ensemble of resources and technology which provides a virtual collaboration tool. An Access Grid can be used as an advanced type of videoconferencing facility that allows participants from multiple locations on the Internet to interact in real time. The Access Grid is more than videoconferencing, as it provides mechanisms to share data, collaborate using a variety of shared applications (such as sharing presentation material), utilize large-format displays and can employ multiple video sources to allow room -to -room conferencing capabilities. The technology was invented at Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, United States of America.</description>

                    <description>ActiveSync is a data synchronization program developed by Microsoft for use with its Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Originally released under the name "Handheld PC Explorer" in 1996, it provides users of Microsoft Windows a way to transport documents, calendars, contact lists and email between their desktop computer and a mobile device, such as a Handheld PC, mobile phone, or any other portable devices that support the ActiveSync protocol. ActiveSync is available as a free download from Microsoft's web site.

Activesync uses ActiveSync Exchange, a proprietary protocol, requiring other vendors to license the protocol to achieve compatibility.

ActiveSync also refers to a push messaging component first included with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003.</description>

                    <description>With the introduction of Adobe Flash Player 9,0,124,0, Flash Player will not make a socket connection directly to a server without first obtaining explicit permission from that server. This will require some systems and networks to open up ports or run new services in order to support granting permission.  Adobe has filed with IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, to reserve port 843 for the purposes of serving socket policy files.</description>

                    <description>Adobe Media Player is a desktop media player that allows users to manage and interact with their media content, and allows content publishers to define branding and advertising in and around their content. The Adobe Media Player will be one of the first Adobe AIR applications from Adobe Systems. It was announced at NAB show in Las Vegas and was released in April 2008.

The software uses DRM and enforces advert viewing, when watching videos both online and offline.

According to the Adobe Website: "Effective June 18, 2009, Adobe Media Player software no longer contains third-party content in the default catalog. As part of Adobe's initiative to focus on and streamline business priorities, the decision was made to refocus efforts away from content aggregation."

The catalog now contains Adobe tutorial videos and no other content. Flash video content can be added to the application if it is stored on your computer.</description>

                    <description>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing (including point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe), reliability and security. AMQP mandates the behaviour of the messaging provider and client to the extent that implementations from different vendors are truly interoperable. Some of the publicly available AMQP implementations include OpenAMQ, StormMQ, RabbitMQ, Apache Qpid, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG.</description>

                    <description>The Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) is a binary protocol that can proxy inbound requests from a web server through to an application server (such as Tomcat) that sits behind the web server. Web implementors typically use AJP in a load-balanced deployment where one or more front-end web servers feed requests into one or more application servers.</description>

                    <description>A software tool by Apple Computer that installs the latest version of Apple software on computers running Mac OS X. It was originally introduced to Mac users in Mac OS 9. A Windows version has been available since the introduction of iTunes 7, under the name Apple Software Update. Software Update automatically informs users of new updates. Software update can be set to check for updates daily, weekly, monthly, or not at all; in addition, it can download and store the associated .pkg file (the same type used by Installer) to be installed at a later date and maintains a history of installed updates.

It is recommended that all users fully update their software as new versions become available. Software Updates consist of incremental updates of the Mac OS and its applications, Security Updates, device drivers and firmware updates. All software updates require a password, as with all consequential system changes. Some updates require a system restart.</description>

                    <description>Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Its name comes from the asterisk symbol, "*".

Asterisk is released under a dual license model, using the GNU General Public License (GPL) as a free software license and a proprietary software license to permit licensees to distribute proprietary, unpublished system components.

Due to free licensing of the software, hundreds of community programmers have contributed features and functionality and have reported and corrected bugs. Originally designed for Linux, Asterisk now also runs on a variety of different operating systems including NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris. A port to Microsoft Windows is known as AsteriskWin32.</description>

                    <description>The name Atom applies to a pair of relatedi standards. The Atom Syndication Format is an XML language used for web feeds, while the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP is the acronym, but it is referred to as 'AtomPub' for short) is a simple HTTP-based protocol for creating and updating Web resources.  Web feeds allow software programs to check for updates published on a web site. To provide a web feed, a site owner may use specialized software (such as a content management system) that publishes a list (or "feed") of recent articles or content in a standardized, machine-readable format. The feed can then be downloaded by web sites that syndicate content from the feed, or by feed reader programs that allow Internet users to subscribe to feeds and view their content. </description>

                    <description>Backup Exec is backup software for Microsoft Windows environments currently developed by Symantec. Backup Exec has a long history of being sold from one company to another. Its earliest roots stretch back to the early 1980s when Maynard Electronics created a bundle of software drivers to help sell their tape drive products. A version of Backup Exec, called NT Backup, was included in Windows NT 3.5.

Today, Backup Exec is a data protection solution that provides continuous disk-to-disk-to-tape backup and recovery. Continuous protection is now available for Microsoft Exchange and SQL Server in addition to file servers and workstations, eliminating daily backups and providing point-in-time recovery.</description>

                    <description>BACnet, an ASHRAE building automation and control networking protocol, was designed specifically to meet the communication needs of building automation and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control, lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms by which computerized building automation devices can exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform. As a result, the BACnet protocol may be used by head-end workstation, general-purpose direct digital controllers, and application specific or unitary controllers with equal effect.</description>

                    <description>Battle.net is a gaming service provided by Blizzard Entertainment. Battle.net was launched in November 30, 1996 with the release of Blizzard's action-RPG Diablo. Battle.net was the first online gaming service incorporated directly into the games that make use of it, in contrast to the external interfaces used by the other online services at the time. This feature, along with ease of account creations and the absence of member fees, caused Battle.net to become popular among gamers and became a major selling point for Diablo and subsequent Blizzard games. Since the successful launch of Battle.net, many companies have published online game services mimicking the service package of Blizzard and the user interface.</description>

                    <description>Battlefield 2 (commonly abbreviated to BF2) is a computer game by the Swedish developer Digital Illusions CE (DICE). During development, Trauma Studios contributed to the development of the game after it was acquired by DICE. Battlefield 2 is published by Electronic Arts and is the third full game in the Battlefield series, released on June 21, 2005 in North America for Microsoft Windows. The latest version is v1.50, which was released on September 1, 2009 and added the content of the Euro Force and Armored Fury booster packs, as well as the Highway Tampa and Operation Blue Pearl maps.

Players fight in a modern battlefield, using modern weapon systems. Battlefield 2 is a first-person shooter with some strategy and RPG elements. The single player features missions that involve clashes between US Marines, China and the fictional Middle East Coalition. The multiplayer aspect of the game allows players to organize into squads that come under the leadership of a single commander to promote teamwork.

                    <description>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the core routing protocol of the Internet. It works by maintaining a table of IP networks or 'prefixes' which designate network reachability between autonomous systems (AS). It is described as a path vector protocol. BGP does not use traditional IGP metrics, but makes routing decisions based on path, network policies and/or rulesets. As of January 2006, the current version of BGP, version 4, is codified in RFC 4271.</description>

BitTorrent is a method of distributing large amounts of data widely without the original distributor incurring the entire costs of hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources. Instead, when data is distributed using the BitTorrent protocol, each recipient supplies pieces of the data to newer recipients, reducing the cost and burden on any given individual source, providing redundancy against system problems, and reducing dependence on the original distributor. The protocol is the brainchild of programmer Bram Cohen, who designed it in April 2001 and released a first implementation on 2 July 2001. It is now maintained by Cohen's company BitTorrent, Inc.Usage of the protocol accounts for significant traffic on the Internet, but the precise amount has proven difficult to measure. There are numerous compatible BitTorrent clients, written in a variety of programming languages, and running on a variety of computing platforms, include uTorrent, BitComet, Deluge, TurboBT, and Transmission.  </description>
                    <analysis>      BitTorrent is one of the more innovative and sometimes "legitimate" peer to peer applications available.  Originally implemented by Bram Cohen, BitTorrent was initially both a client and a protocol.  Since that time, there have been many other client software programs that have implemented the BitTorrent protocol, such as uTorrent, BitComet, Azureus, ABC, TurboBT, etc.  Unlike many other peer to peer applications, BitTorrent technology has even been adopted by some companies for distribution of their business data, software and content updates. There are also commercial products for content distribution and storage services that are using BitTorrent technology.
  
      BitTorrent utilizes parallel distribution of content through data partitioning and decentralized management of file directories.  Essentially it partitions a file into smaller pieces called torrents which are then copied among a group of peers.  Each peer, upon receiving a torrent, can start serving the torrent to other peers.  The coordination of "who has what" used to be achieved through centralized servers known as "trackers".  However, these static "trackers" posed vulnerability and legal issues for BitTorrent users, which motivated the introduction of DHT (distributed hash table) to BitTorrent clients. DHT effectively is a "trackerless" method of delivering distributed content. DHT serves as a directory of "who has what", where "what" is a hash key computed from the name of a file to be shared.  The keyspace partitioning scheme determines where the torrents of the file should be kept for distribution.  DHT provides BitTorrent with scalability, fault tolerance, and improved anonymity.

                    <description> Camfrog Video Chat is a program created by Camshare LLC that allows users all over the world to broadcast live streaming audio and video. This software allows over 1,000 users in a live streaming  video conference room.</description>
                    <analysis>
Camfrog is a video chat application and webcam community.  As a chat
application, it allows users to join chat rooms where they can utilize their
webcams to see, hear, and chat with other users.  Camfrog supports a photo
webcam directory where one can find other individual users or groups of users
for private and group video chat.  Camfrog users have a list of Camfrog-hosted
video chat rooms to join, however for users with sufficient bandwidth on their
Internet connections, a separate server software application is available, which
allows users to set up their own Camfrog chat room server to host their own chat
rooms or multi-user videoconferencing.  Chat room topics range from language
oriented rooms, rooms targeted at specific countries or geographic regions,
rooms for singles, and rooms for adults only.  
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Camfrog client software has the ability to traverse firewalls so it works
behind most firewall devices, routers, and over wireless networks. Camfrog's
evasive behavior poses a challenge to enterprise networks given its bandwidth
consumption and ability to function undetected and unmanaged. The Camfrog server
software currently does not have the ability to provide access when it's
deployed behind a firewall with NAT (Network Address Translation). For
Internet-addressable servers behind a firewall, users need to open the following
ports in order to host chat rooms: 
&lt;br/&gt;
TCP 6005: incoming port for client connections
&lt;br/&gt;
UDP 5000-15000: incoming ports for multimedia streams

                    <description>BJNP refers to a printer protocol used by printers made by Canon wherein the accompanying installation software and drivers must be installed first before any printer can be used.  This specific printer protocol is said to be proprietary which simply means that each printer software has a particular license that is copyrighted or owned by the manufacturer.  In the case of the BJNP protocol, Canon is the owner of the printer installation software and driver files.</description>

                    <description>CDDB (which stands for Compact Disc Database) is a licensed trademark of Gracenote, Inc. It is a database for software applications to look up audio CD (compact disc) information over the Internet. This is performed by a client which calculates a (nearly) unique disc ID and then queries the database. As a result, the client is able to display the artist name, CD title, track list and some additional information. 

The database is used primarily by media players and CD ripper software.

The need for CDDB is a direct consequence of the original design of the CD, which was conceived as an evolution of the gramophone record, and did not consider the audio tracks as data files to be identified and indexed. The audio CD format does not include the disc name or track names, so a supplemental database is needed to supply this information when discs are used with modern media systems. A later development called CD-Text is another solution to the same problem. CDDB also seems to be used by some software to identify the songs played on the radio and save them as MP3 tracks.</description>

                    <description>Channel 4 is a UK public-service television broadcaster which began working on November 2, 1982. Although commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station owned now and operated by the Channel Four Television Corporation, a public body established in 1990, coming into operation in 1993.

The channel was established to provide a fourth television service to the UK that would break the duopoly of the Licence Fee-funded BBC's two established services and the single commercial broadcasting network, ITV. Channel 4 enjoys almost universal coverage in the UK and some neighbouring countries and a significant audience share, despite having seen new competition with the growth of cable, satellite and digital services.

Channel 4 was established with, and continues to hold, a remit of public service obligations which it must fulfill. The remit changes periodically, as dictated by various broadcasting and communications acts, and is regulated by the various authorities Channel 4 has been answerable to; originally the IBA, then the ITC and now Ofcom.</description>

                    <description>Chrome Remote Desktop BETA is the first installment on a capability allowing users to remotely access another computer through the Chrome browser or a Chromebook. This version enables users to share with or get access to another computer by providing a one-time authentication code. Access is given only to the specific person the user identifies for one time only, and the sharing session is fully secured. One potential use of this version is the remote IT helpdesk case. The helpdesk can use the Chrome Remote Desktop BETA to help another user, while conversely a user can receive help by setting up a sharing session without leaving their desk. Additional use cases such as being able to access your own computer remotely are coming soon. Chrome Remote Desktop BETA is fully cross-platform, so you can connect any two computers that have a Chrome browser, including Windows, Linux, Mac and Chromebooks.  </description>

                    <description>A circumventor is a method of defeating blocking policies implemented using proxy servers. Ironically, most circumventors are also proxy servers, of varying degrees of sophistication, which effectively implement "bypass policies".  A circumventor is a web-based page that takes a site that is blocked and "circumvents" it through to an unblocked web site, allowing the user to view blocked pages. A famous example is 'elgooG', which allowed users in China to use Google after it had been blocked there. elgooG differs from most circumventors in that it circumvents only one block. </description>

                    <description>Cisco NAC Appliance, formerly Cisco Clean Access (CCA) is a network access control (NAC) system developed by Cisco Systems that helps ensure a secure and clean network environment -- the NAC appliance is however still referred to as Cisco Clean Access by some in the industry. Originally developed by Perfigo and marketed under the name of Perfigo SmartEnforcer, this network admission control device analyzes systems attempting to access the network and prevents vulnerable computers from joining the network. The system usually installs a small application known as the Clean Access Agent on a computer. This application, in conjunction with both a Clean Access server and a Clean Access Manager, has become quite common in many universities and corporate environments today. It is capable of managing wired networks in an in-band or out-of-band configuration mode, or Wi-Fi and Virtual Private networks (VPN) in an in-band only configuration mode.

                    <description>Clearspace is a commercial Java EE based Enterprise 2.0 collaboration and knowledge management tool produced by Jive Software. It is unusual in that it integrates the functionality of discussion forums, blogs, wikis, IM chat and VOIP under one unified user interface. From a user perspective, input is fairly format-agnostic as collaborative content placed into any system (blog, wiki, documentation, etc) can later be retrieved through use of a common search interface. Other features include RSS capability, email integration, a reputation and reward system for participation, and personal user profiles.</description>

Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion. </description>

                    <description>The Coral Content Distribution Network, sometimes called Coral Cache or Coral for short, is a free peer-to-peer content distribution network designed to mirror web content. Coral uses the bandwidth of volunteers to avoid slashdotting/the Digg effect and to reduce the load on websites and other web content providers in general. This leverages the bandwidth of the participating Coral nodes as proxy servers, so it is similar to a distributed web proxy.

To access a website through the Coral cache (and thus reduce the load on the site and use the Coral network instead), one simply has to add .nyud.net to the hostname in the site's URL. So, for example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page becomes http://en.wikipedia.org.nyud.net/wiki/Main_Page. The latter is known as a coralized link. Originally, the port was 8090, later 8080 was added in 2006 and now port 80 is used (the standard HTTP port).

                    <description>CPMI (Check Point Management Interface) is the interface to Check Point's central policy and objects database that enables third party applications to securely access the security policy stored in the management server. CPMI available in the NG OPSEC SDK, replaces OMI with Read/Write access to the policy and objects database. With this interface vendors can build sophisticated applications that can share common objects defined in the firewall. By sharing objects, the user will only need to define them once, simplifying the overall manageability of the solution. Additionally, by using SSL, CPMI can be used remotely to enable applications to access the policy from a remote client.</description>

                    <description>The Mini Remote Control program offers quick and easy "on the fly" deployment of its client agent service to remote machines.  Giving an administrator the ability to remotely install the client agent service eliminates the need to physically visit the remote machine to install the software. This gives administrators the unique ability to remote control any machine on the LAN or WAN (across town, across the country, or even around the world) in a matter of seconds. </description>

                    <description>The DAYTIME service is an Internet protocol defined in RFC 867. It is intended for testing and measurement purposes of computer networks. A host may connect to a server that supports the DAYTIME protocol, on either TCP or UDP port 13. The server then returns the current date and time as an ASCII string with an unspecified format.</description>

                    <description>The Distributed Checksum Clearinghouses or DCC is an anti-spam content filter that runs on a variety of operating systems. As of 2010, it involves millions of users, more than six hundred thousand client computer systems, and about 200 servers collecting and counting checksums related to more than 300 million mail messages on week days. The counts can be used by SMTP servers and mail user agents to detect and reject or filter spam or unsolicited bulk mail. DCC servers exchange or "flood" common checksums. The checksums include values that are constant across common variations in bulk messages, including "personalizations."</description>

                    <description>Deezer is a free French music streaming service. Deezer has negotiated rights to make 165,000 songs available for streaming legally via an agreement with Sony, as well as some of Universal's catalogue, however all the other tracks they provide appear to be used without the permission of the copyright holder. There are also issues of legality relating to the uploading and sharing of music on Deezer.

Deezer was the first music site in France to sign an agreement with a publisher rights' organisation to reimburse artists through advertising revenue.

There are 4 million registered Deezer users according to the home page of the website. There are 3.7 million songs available on Deezer.</description>

                    <description>Desktoptwo is a free Desktop as a Service (DaaS) or Webtop developed by Sapotek that mimics the look, feel and functionality of the desktop environment of an operating system. The software is currently in beta stage yet has acquired, along with its sister site in Spanish called Computadora.de, more than 210,000 active users since its launch in August 2006. Desktoptwo is fully web-based and requires Adobe Flash Player to operate. Unlike some other online desktops, which are more akin to aggregators of stand-alone applications, the web applications found on Desktoptwo are built on the same open source scripting language, PHP, and as a result are interoperable and include, for example, drag-and-drop functionality. Sapotek is also the sponsor of a free software community, Sapodesk, through which it has liberated all the web applications found on Desktoptwo and works with community members to create additional open source web applications and rich Internet applications.</description>

                    <description>DHCP is a set of rules used by communications devices such as a computer, router or network adapter to allow the device to request and obtain an IP address from a server which has a list of addresses available for assignment.

DHCP uses and extends some facilities defined in the BOOTP (Boot Protocol).</description>

                    <description>DHCPv6 is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6. Although IPv6's stateless address autoconfiguration removes the primary motivation for DHCP in IPv6, DHCPv6 can still be used to assign addresses statefully if the network administrator desires more control over addressing. It can also be used to distribute other configuration information as is the practice in IPv4. A notable case are Domain Name System servers used on a network, albeit other mechanisms exist for this in the Neighbor Discovery Protocol.</description>

                    <description>DNP3 is based on the standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Technical Committee 57, Working Group 03 who have been working on an OSI 3 layer "Enhanced Performance Architecture" (EPA) protocol standard for telecontrol applications. DNP3 has been designed to be as close to compliant as possible to the standards as they existed at time of development with the addition of functionality not identified in Europe but needed for current and future North American applications (e.g. limited transport layer functions to support 2K block transfers for IEDs, RF and fiber support). DNP3 has been selected as a Recommended Practice by the IEEE C.2 Task Force; RTU to IED Communications Protocol.</description>

                    <description>The Domain Name System (DNS) stores and associates many types of information with domain names, it translates domain names (computer hostnames) to IP addresses, as the ""phone book"" for the Internet. It translates human-readable computer hostnames, e.g. www.paloaltonetworks.com, into the IP addresses that networking equipment needs for delivering information. It also stores other information such as the list of mail exchange servers that accept e-mail for a given domain.  </description>

                    <description>"Don't censor me" allows you to surf the web uncensored using it's collection of suffix proxy servers. Suffix proxy servers are chosen, because they are easier to use than regular proxy servers.

A suffix proxy server allows a user to access web content by appending the hostname of the proxy server to the URL of the requested content. To use a suffix proxy server with hostname "6a.nl" to visit "www.google.com" you simply enter "www.google.com.6a.nl" in your browsers address bar.

"Don't censor me" uses proxy servers meant to bypass censorship, not for anonymous internet access or protecting your privacy. Every request the proxy makes for you will contain your IP address in the "X-Forwarded-For" header.

The consequence of using a proxy (in general) is that you send all your data unencrypted through some other server. The person running this server can look at or into your traffic. Therefor DO NOT log in to any accounts (not even using a secure connection) unless you FULLY trust the person running the proxy server. </description>

                    <description>Dropbox is a storage application and service operated by Evenflow, Inc. The service enables users to store and sync files online and between computers. Dropbox has a cross-platform client (Windows, Mac and Linux) that enables users to drop any file into a Dropbox folder that is then synced to the web and the users' other computers with the Dropbox client. Files in the Dropbox folder may then be shared with other Dropbox users or accessed from the web. Users may also upload files manually through a web browser. A free Dropbox account offers 2 GB of storage. Users may upgrade to 50 GB by paying a monthly or yearly fee.

While Dropbox functions as a storage service, its focus is on synchronization and sharing. Dropbox synchronization uses SSL transfers with AES-256 encryption, and it supports revision history, so files deleted from the Dropbox folder may be recovered from any of the synced computers. Dropbox's version control also helps users know the history of a file they may be currently working on, enabling more than one person to edit and re-post files without complications of losing its previous form. There is no limit to file size for files added via the Dropbox application, but files transferred through the web interface are capped at 350 MB. Dropbox uses Amazon's S3 storage system to store the files.

The Dropbox service is similar to companies such as Box.net, Mozy, Wuala and the now defunct Omnidrive and XDrive. The major feature (and limitation) of the Dropbox system is that only files in the Dropbox folder are backed up and synced. The company received seed funding from Y Combinator and Sequoia Capital. </description>

DTLS allows datagram-based applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the stream-oriented Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and is intended to provide similar security guarantees.</description>

                    <description>The ELCOM communication concept is a result of a joint project initiated by SINTEF Energy Research, former EFI (Norwegian Electric Power Research Institute). The impetus for the development was the need to exchange information in a hierarchical process control system which consisted of both hardware (computers) and software from different manufacturers. The ISO Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model forms the basis for the ELCOM protocols. The services provided by the application layer of ELCOM are designed to satisfy the requirements of communications between computers running different Power Application Software (i.e. SCADA, EMS, planning, power market) within a power utility, between computers running PAS between different power utilities, between control systems at different levels.</description>

                    <description>EMC Legato NetWorker - now known simply as EMC NetWorker - is an enterprise level cross-platform backup and recovery suite produced by EMC Corporation. It provides backup functionality to Linux, Windows, Macintosh, NetWare, OpenVMS and Unix environments.
It is set up as a data zone containing a central NetWorker server that manages both storage nodes (accessing the backup media) and clients. Core server platforms are AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris SPARC &amp;amp; x64, SGI IRIX and Tru64. Multiple data zones can be managed by the NetWorker Management Console which is bundled with the NetWorker distribution. NetWorker comes with support for many hardware devices like tape drives, tape libraries, virtual tape libraries, disk units and Avamar deduplication devices.
The client software is used for the backup of file system and system state. Different modules are available for hot backups of major database products like Oracle, MS SQL Server and Sybase, or applications like MS Exchange or SAP. All data can be sent either to a remote storage node or locally attached storage devices. 
VMware virtual machines can be backed up either directly by installing the client on the virtual machine (the client is licensed by physical node) or through the VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) interface provided by VMWare. NetWorker also supports backup and recovery of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V virtual servers using the Volume Shadow Copy Services interface for protection of the parent and child partitions (guests) as well as applications running within virtual machines. </description>

                    <description>eMule is a peer-to-peer file sharing application for Microsoft Windows. Started in May 2002 as an alternative to eDonkey2000, eMule now connects to both the eDonkey network and the Kad network. The distinguishing features of eMule are the direct exchange of sources between client nodes, fast recovery of corrupted downloads, and the use of a credit system to reward frequent uploaders. Furthermore, eMule transmits data in zlib-compressed form to save bandwidth.</description>

                    <description>ESET Remote Administrator (ERA) is an application which allows you to manage ESET’s products in a networked environment, including workstations and servers – from one central location. With ESET Remote Administrator‘s builtin task management system, you can install ESET security solutions on remote computers and quickly respond to new problems and threats. ESET Remote Administrator itself does not provide any other form of protection against malicious code. ERA depends on the presence of an ESET security solution on workstations or servers, such as ESET NOD32 Antivirus or ESET Smart Security.</description>

                    <description>Facebook (branded as "facebook") is a social networking website launched on February 4, 2004. The free-access website is privately owned and operated by Facebook, Inc. Users can join networks organized by city, workplace, school, and region to connect and interact with other people. People can also add friends and send them messages, and update their personal profile to notify friends about themselves. The website's name refers to the paper facebooks depicting members of a campus community that some American colleges and prepatory schools give to incoming students, faculty, and staff as a way to get to know other people on campus. Features include a Wall for posting messages and Photos for uploading digital photos. The website has more than 80 million active users worldwide.

Facebook has met with some controversy over the past few years. It has been blocked in several countries including Syria and Iran. Privacy has also been an issue, and it has been compromised several times. It is also facing several lawsuits from a number of Zuckerberg's former classmates, who claim that Facebook had stolen their source code and other intellectual property. </description>

                    <description>Facebook launched the Facebook Platform on May 24, 2007, providing a framework for software developers to create applications that interact with core Facebook features. A markup language called Facebook Markup Language was introduced simultaneously; it is used to customize the "look and feel" of applications that developers create. Using the Platform, Facebook launched several new applications, including Gifts, allowing users to send virtual gifts to each other, Marketplace, allowing users to post free classified ads, Events, giving users a method of informing their friends about upcoming events, and Video, letting users share homemade videos with one another.

Applications that have been created on the Platform include chess and Scrabble, which both allow users to play games with their friends. These games are asynchronous, meaning that a user's moves are saved on the website, allowing the next move to be made at any time rather than immediately after the previous move.

By November 3, 2007, seven thousand applications had been developed on the Facebook Platform, with another hundred created every day. By the second annual f8 developers conference on July 23, 2008, the number of applications had grown to 33,000, and the number of registered developers had exceeded 400,000.

Within a few months of launching the Facebook Platform, issues arose regarding "application spam", which involves Facebook applications "spamming" users to request it be installed. Application spam has been considered one of the possible causes to the drop in visitors to Facebook starting from the beginning of 2008, when its growth had fallen from December 2007 to January 2008, its first drop since its launch in 2004. </description>

                    <description>Social plugins are simple tools that can be "dropped" into any website to provide people with personalized and social experiences. Using social plugins, websites everywhere can give you more ways to experience the web with your friends--from letting you form connections on these sites with your favorite movies or restaurants to showing you the most popular content based on what is being shared among your friends. Rather than seeing popular stories, products or reviews from people you don't know, you'll now see content that matters to you the most--from your friends--displayed prominently.</description>

                    <description>Fast and Secure Protocol (FASP) is an alternative to transmission control protocol (TCP) developed by Aspera Inc. It is currently being promoted by Amazon.com in association with its cloud computing services as a way to greatly accelerate the rate of data transfer over the public Internet. In tests, FSAP has been shown to perform 22 times better than standard TCP over short distances with relatively little packet loss and up to 800 times better over longer distances with more significant packet loss. These speed increases are achieved by sending larger packets than TCP, not waiting for confirmation that a packet has been received before sending the next one, and only resending packets that are confirmed as having been dropped (instead of more aggressively slowing the data transfer, which TCP does to avoid overloading the network). </description>

                    <description>FileMaker Pro is a cross-platform database application from FileMaker Inc. (a subsidiary of Apple Inc.), known for its combination of power and ease of use. It is also noted for the integration of the database engine with its GUI-based interface, which allows users to modify the database by dragging new elements into the layouts/screens/forms that provide the user interface. This results in a "quasi-object" development environment of a kind that is still largely unique in the "industrial strength" database world.</description>

                    <description>FilesWire is a Web-based peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) client for the Java Platform, which uses a combination of the G3 network and the Gnutella network to locate files as well as share files. FilesWire is closed source but can be used directly from the FilesWire website without having to pay a fee or register any user related credentials.

As with all file-sharing programs, using FilesWire to download or upload copyrighted files without permission from the authors is generally illegal. Using it to distribute files with permission from the authors, or files that are out of copyright, is generally legal. For more information, see File sharing and the law.</description>

                    <description>Adobe Flash (previously called Macromedia Flash) is a multimedia platform originally acquired by Macromedia and currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages; Flash is commonly used to create animation, advertisements, and various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop rich Internet applications.

Flash can manipulate vector and raster graphics and supports bi-directional streaming of audio and video. It contains a scripting language called ActionScript. Several software products, systems, and devices are able to create or display Flash content, including Adobe Flash Player, which is available for most common web browsers, some mobile phones and other electronic devices (using Flash Lite). The Adobe Flash Professional multimedia authoring program is used to create content for the Adobe Engagement Platform, such as web applications, games and movies, and content for mobile phones and other embedded devices.

Files in the SWF format, traditionally called "ShockWave Flash" movies, "Flash movies" or "Flash games", usually have a .swf file extension and may be an object of a web page, strictly "played" in a standalone Flash Player, or incorporated into a Projector, a self-executing Flash movie (with the .exe extension in Microsoft Windows). Flash Video (FLV) files have a .flv file extension and are either used from within .swf files or played through a flv aware player, such as VLC, or QuickTime and Windows Media Player with external codecs added.</description>

                    <description>FlexNet Publisher (formerly known as FLEXlm) is a common software license manager from Flexera Software which implements license management and is intended to be used in corporate environments to provide floating licenses to multiple end users of computer software.

Computer software can be licensed in a variety of ways. A license to use a piece of software may be associated with a specific machine (node-locked), permitting it to only run on that machine (node in a network); alternatively, a company may buy a pool of floating licenses and these licenses may be allocated dynamically to machines, a license being checked-out when a user begins using the software on any given machine and checked-in when the user finishes using the software. In this way, for example, a company might buy a pool of 50 licenses but support a user community of hundreds of occasional users of the software (so long as no more than 50 users ever want to use the software simultaneously).</description>

                    <description>Flickr is an image and video hosting website, web services suite, and online community platform. It was one of the earliest Web 2.0 applications. In addition to being a popular Web site for users to share personal photographs, the service is widely used by bloggers as a photo repository. Its popularity has been fueled by its organization tools, which allow photos to be tagged and browsed by folksonomic means. As of November 2007, it claims to host more than 2 billion images. </description>

                    <description>Folding-at-home is a distributed computing project designed to perform computationally intensive simulations of protein folding and other molecular dynamics simulations. Folding-at-home does not rely on powerful supercomputers for its data processing; instead, the primary contributors to the Folding-at-home project are many hundreds of thousands of personal computer users who have installed a small client program. The client will, at the user's choice, run in the background, utilizing otherwise unused CPU power, or run as a screensaver only while the user is away. In most modern personal computers, the CPU is rarely used to its full capacity at all times; the Folding-at-home client takes advantage of this unused processing power.</description>

                    <description>Freegate is software that enables internet users from mainland China, Iran, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and United Arab Emirates, among others, to view websites blocked by their governments. The program takes advantage of a range of open proxies, which allow users to penetrate firewalls used to block web sites. Developer Dynamic Internet Technology (DIT) estimates Freegate has 200,000 users. </description>

                    <description>Freenet is free software that lets users anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet), and chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet's peer-to-peer network uses a decentralized distributed data store that works by pooling the contributed bandwidth and storage space of member computers. Files are encrypted and so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in his data store. Content on the network can be accessed through a web interface or through separate applications and plug-ins loaded into the software. Freenet was originally designed by Ian Clarke and has been under continuous development since 2000.</description>

                    <description>FriendFeed is a real-time feed aggregator that consolidates the updates from social media and social networking websites, social bookmarking websites, blogs and micro-blogging updates, as well as any other type of RSS/ Atom feed. It is possible to use this stream of information to create customized feeds to share, as well as originate new posts-discussions, (and comment) with friends. The goal of FriendFeed according to their website is to make content on the Web more relevant and useful by using existing social network as a tool for discovering interesting information. Users can be an individual, business or organization. Bloggers writing about FriendFeed have said that this service addresses the shortcomings of social media services which exclusively facilitate tracking of their own members' social media activities on that particular social media service, whereas FriendFeed provides the facility to track these activities (such as posting on blogs, Twitter and Flickr) across a broad range of different social networks. Some bloggers are concerned about readers commenting on their posts inside FriendFeed instead of on their blogs, resulting in fewer page views for the blogger.</description>

                    <description>G.ho.st provides every person in the world with a free Virtual Computer (VC). Like a Windows PC, or Mac, the VC is a personal computing environment which includes your desktop, your personal settings, your files and your choice of software applications. But unlike a PC, your VC is not installed on one physical computer - instead it is stored in professional data centers across the Internet cloud, and is accessed from any Internet browser in the world.</description>

                    <description>GameSpy, also known as GameSpy Industries, is a division of IGN Entertainment, which operates a network of game websites and provides online video game-related services and software. GameSpy dates back to the 1996 release of an internet Quake server search program named QSpy. The current company is headquartered in Costa Mesa, California. It is currently controlled by News Corporation, the 92.3% shareholder of its parent company, IGN - which was bought for $650 million on September 8, 2005. GameSpy includes coverage for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, Xbox, Xbox 360, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, N-Gage, Wireless, PC, and Retrogaming.

The company's "Powered by GameSpy" technology has enabled online functionality in over 300 PC and PlayStation 2 games. In 2005 GameSpy added the PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo DS to its stable supported platforms. In March 2007, GameSpy added the Wii as another supported platform and will help get some of its games online.</description>

                    <description>Gbridge enables privacy by establishing a VPN tunnel inside of a Google Gtalk instant messaging session (note that Gbridge is not a Google application – it is an extension written by another developer). A Gbridge user can then connect to multiple PCs (outside the firewall) that are logged in under the same Gtalk user account. Gbridge can also be extended to Gtalk friends based on invitation, enabling them to perform such popular functions as folder synchronization, remote desktop share (VNC), automatic backup, live browsing and chat, etc. – all in an encrypted manner. To most security devices, Gbridge will pass undetected, looking like HTTP traffic, or at most instant messaging traffic, which may or may not pose a risk to the enterprise. Unbeknownst to the security team, hidden inside of the IM session is an encrypted connection that may be performing unauthorized file sharing or acting as a completely hidden inbound threat vector.  </description>

                    <description>GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on inside another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed. GDB offers a 'remote' mode often used when debugging embedded systems. Remote operation is when GDB runs on one machine and the program being debugged runs on another. GDB can communicate to the remote 'stub' which understands GDB protocol via Serial or TCP/IP.</description>

                    <description>Gmail accounts are automatically enabled with chat features. Without an additional client, users can see when friends are online and start an IM session with them within Gmail.  Conversation logs are automatically saved to a Chats area in the user's Gmail account. This allows users to search within their chat logs easily, and to have them centrally stored in their Gmail accounts. In addition to integration with Google Talk, chats can be initiated with users of the AIM network.</description>

                    <description>GMail Drive is a free third-party Windows Shell namespace extension ("add-on") for Google's Gmail. GMail Drive is not supported by Google. It allows a user to access a virtual drive stored in a Gmail e-mail account by causing the contents of the Gmail account to appear as a new network share on the user's workstation. In order to use this add-on, the user needs a Gmail e-mail account. The add-on enables the user to use the standard Windows desktop file copy and paste commands to transfer files to and from the Gmail account as if it were a drive on the user's computer.</description>

                    <description>httptunnel creates a bidirectional virtual data connection tunnelled in HTTP requests. The HTTP requests can be sent via an HTTP proxy if so desired.This can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls. If WWW access is allowed through a HTTP proxy, it's possible to use httptunnel and, say, telnet or PPP to connect to a computer outside the firewall.</description>

                    <description>Gnutella is a file sharing network. As of December 2005, Gnutella was the third-most-popular file sharing network on the Internet, following eDonkey 2000 and FastTrack. In June of 2005, Gnutella's population was 1.81 million computers. With the decline of Fasttrack and the emergence of Bittorrent, Gnutella is feasibly still firmly established as third-largest peer-to-peer network. There are many popular clients for Gnutella including Limewire, Morpheus, BearFlix, BearShare, Phex, Acquisition, and Shareaza. </description>

                    <description>Google Buzz is a social networking and messaging tool from Google, designed to integrate into the company's web-based email program, Gmail. Users can share links, photos, videos, status messages and comments organized in "conversations" and visible in the user's inbox.

Buzz allows users to choose to share publicly with the world or privately to a group of friends each time they post. Picasa, Flickr, Google Reader, YouTube, Blogger, and Twitter are currently integrated. The creation of Buzz was seen by industry analysts as an attempt by Google to compete with social networking websites like Facebook and microblogging services like Twitter. Buzz also includes several interface and interaction elements from other Google products (e.g. Google Reader) such as the ability to "like" a post.</description>

                    <description>Google takes a snapshot of each page it examines and caches (stores) that version as a back-up. The cached version is what Google uses to judge if a page is a good match for your query.

Practically every search result includes a Cached link. Clicking on that link takes you to the Google cached version of that web page, instead of the current version of the page. This is useful if the original page is unavailable because of: Internet congestion, a down, overloaded, or just slow website, the owner's recently removing the page from the Web. Sometimes you can access the cached version from a site that otherwise require registration or a subscription.

Since Google's servers are typically faster than many web servers, you can often access a page's cached version faster than the page itself.

If Google returns a link to a page that appears to have little to do with your query, or if you can't find the information you're seeking on the current version of the page, take a look at the cached version.</description>

                    <description>Google-docs is a free, Web-based word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation application offered by Google. It allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real-time with other users.

Documents, spreadsheets, and presentations can be created within the application itself, imported through the web interface, or sent via email. They can also be saved to the user's computer in a variety of formats. By default, they are saved to Google's servers. Open documents are automatically saved to prevent data loss, and a full revision history is automatically kept. Documents can be tagged and archived for organizational purposes.

Collaboration between users is also a feature of Google Docs. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users at the same time. In the case of spreadsheets, users can be notified of changes to any specified regions via e-mail.

The application supports popular Office file types such as .doc or .xls. It also includes support for the OpenDocument  format.</description>

                    <description>Google Talk (GTalk) is a Windows and web-based application for voice over internet protocol (VOIP) and instant messaging, offered by Google Inc. The first beta version of the program was released on August 24, 2005.

Instant messaging between the Google Talk servers and its clients uses an open protocol, XMPP, allowing users of other XMPP clients to communicate with Google Talk users. VoIP in Google Talk is based around the Jingle protocol. The technology used within the Google server network however is not publicly known.

The Google Talk client is only available for Microsoft Windows (2000, XP, Server 2003, and Vista). Mobile clients are also available for the Blackberry, iPhone and T-Mobile G1. With the release of the Google Talk gadget, users of all platforms supported by Adobe Flash Player can also use Google Talk. Many other XMPP clients are compatible with Google Talk, and support a variety of other platforms.

On March 14, 2007, Google released the Google Talk Gadget, an Adobe Flash-based Talk module that can be added to iGoogle (formally the Google Personalized Homepage) or embedded in any web page, thus, allowing one to chat from any operating system, without the need to install software.</description>

                    <description>Google Translate is a service provided by Google Inc. to translate a section of text, or a webpage, into another language. The service limits the number of paragraphs, or range of technical terms, that will be translated. It is also possible to enter searches in a source language that are first translated to a destination language allowing you to browse and interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language. For some languages, users are asked for alternate translations such as for technical terms, to be included for future updates to the translation process. Text in a foreign language can be typed, and if "Detect Language" is selected, it will not only detect the language, but it will translate into English by default.

Unlike other translation services such as Babel Fish, AOL, and Yahoo which use SYSTRAN, Google uses its own translation software. Some say that this could lead to a revolution in modern language industry. 

Google Translate, like other automatic translation tools, has its limitations. While it can help the reader to understand the general content of a foreign language text, it does not always deliver accurate translations. Some languages produce better results than others. 

It does not apply grammatical rules, since its algorithms are based on statistical analysis rather than traditional rule-based analysis.

Languages written in Devanagari or the Arabic script and its variants can be transliterated automatically from phonetic equivalents written in the Latin alphabet. </description>

                    <description>Google Video is a free video sharing website and also a video search engine from Google that allows anyone to upload video clips to Google's web servers as well as make their own media available free of charge; some videos are also offered for sale through the Google Video Store.

Uploaded videos were saved as a .gvi files under the "Google Videos" folder in "My Videos" and reports of the video(s) details are logged and stored in the user account. The report sorts and lists the number of times that each of the users videos have been viewed and downloaded within a specific time frame. These range from the previous day, week, month or the entire time that the videos have been there for. Totals are calculated and displayed and the information can be downloaded into a spreadsheet format or printed out.

Competing services include iFilm, Metacafe, Veoh, blip.tv, IKlipz.com, and Outloud.tv. On October 9, 2006 Google agreed to buy former competitor YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock, but YouTube will remain a separate service under its own identity for the near future, though Google Video searches include YouTube results as well.

Google announced on June 13, 2007 that the Google Video search results would begin to include videos discovered by their search crawlers on other hosting services, in addition to YouTube's and their own uploads. Search result links now open a frameset with a Google Video header at the top, and the original player page below it, similar to the way the Google Images search results are presented.</description>

                    <description>Google Wave is a self-described "personal communication and collaboration tool" announced by Google at the Google I/O conference on May 27, 2009. It is a web-based service, computing platform, and communications protocol designed to merge e-mail, instant messaging, wikis, and social networking. It has a strong collaborative and real-time focus supported by extensions that can provide, for example, spelling/grammar checking, automated translation among 40 languages, and numerous other extensions. Initially released only to developers, a "preview release" of Google Wave was extended to 100,000 users in September 2009, each allowed to invite twenty to thirty additional users. On the 29th of November 2009, Google accepted most requests submitted soon after the extended release of the technical preview in September 2009, these users have around 25 invitations to give.</description>

                    <description>GridFTP is an extension of the standard File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for use with Grid computing. It is defined as part of the Globus toolkit, under the organization of the Global Grid Forum (specifically, by the GridFTP working group). The aim of GridFTP is to provide a more reliable and high performance file transfer for Grid computing applications. This is necessary because of the increased demands of transmitting data in Grid computing - it is frequently necessary to transmit very large files, and this needs to be done fast and reliably.</description>

                    <description>Microsoft Groove is a collaboration tool that helps teams work together dynamically and effectively, even if team members work for different organizations, work remotely, or work offline. Groove works in conjunction with Microsoft SharePoint in either an online or offline mode. The offline mode targets teams with members who are usually off-line or who do not all share the same network security clearance. One interesting fact about Groove is that its underlying technology is peer-to-peer, which, in this case, is a positive use of a very powerful technology that has a very bad reputation due to its use for file-sharing of copyrighted materials. Microsoft Groove is a peer-to-peer application that uses either port 80 or port 2492 to pass through the firewall. </description>

                    <description>Grooveshark is a web-based music application built for anyone on the internet to listen to music on-demand at no charge.

Users have the ability to listen to single songs from the 7-million song catalog, save playlists, and embed both on other websites, blogs, and social media profiles via the Grooveshark Widget.

Grooveshark also offers music artists and record labels to promote themselves through the application with both advertisement and paying for listens from Grooveshark users. All data and analytics relating to an artist (or group of artists) are freely available to promoters, such as the number of times their content has been listened to, along with demographic and geographic information about the listeners.

                    <description>GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) is a group of IP-based communications protocols used to carry General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) within GSM and UMTS networks.
GTP can be decomposed into separate protocols, GTP-C, GTP-U and GTP'. GTP-C is used within the GPRS core network for signaling between Gateway GPRS Support Nodes (GGSN) and Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSN). This allows the SGSN to activate a session on a user's behalf (PDP context activation), to deactivate the same session, to adjust quality of service parameters, or to update a session for a subscriber who has just arrived from another SGSN.
GTP-U is used for carrying user data within the GPRS Core Network and between the Radio Access Network and the core network. The user data transported can be packets in any of IPv4, IPv6, or PPP formats.
GTP' (GTP prime) uses the same message structure as GTP-C and GTP-U, but has an independent function. It can be used for carrying charging data from the Charging Data Function (CDF) of the GSM or UMTS network to the Charging Gateway Function (CGF). In most cases, this should mean from many individual network elements such as the GGSNs to a centralized computer that delivers the charging data more conveniently to the network operator's billing center.
Different GTP variants are implemented by RNCs, SGSNs, GGSNs and CGFs within 3GPP networks. GPRS mobile stations (MSs) are connected to a SGSN without being aware of GTP.
GTP can be used with UDP or TCP. GTP version one is used only on UDP.</description>

                    <description>GTunnel is the latest product released in October 2007. It features a new transport protocol which enables GTunnel to provide local SOCKS proxy support, and new working modes. GTunnel version 1.1 provides a standard mode, which is the main working mode and provides the best data transfer performance by connecting to the back-end servers directly, a Skype mode, and a Tor mode that go through computers in these P2P network. GTunnel also has an improved user interface which features real-time traffic graphs.

GTunnel replaces the earlier Garden and G2 client software and becomes the main client software of Garden Networks.

GTunnel works on Linux through Wine support.</description>

                    <description>H.225.0 is a member of the H.323 family of protocols.

The main objective of H.225.0 is the definition of messages and procedures for:

    * Call Signaling: establish, control and end an H.323 call. The call signaling of H.225.0 is based on the call setup procedures for ISDN, Recommendation Q.931.

    * RAS Signaling Function: perform registration, admission, bandwidth changes, status and disengage procedures between endpoints and an H.323 Gatekeeper. The RAS signaling function uses a separate channel (RAS channel). This set of messages is called Registration, Admission and Status (RAS).

                    <description>Hamachi is a centrally-managed zero-configuration VPN freeware application capable of establishing direct links between computers that are behind NAT firewalls without requiring reconfiguration. </description>
                    <analysis>Hamachi VPN is a simple and innovative virtual private networking (VPN) application, frequently used for gaming and remote administration that allows a computer to establish a connection over the Internet to other computers as if they were physically connected together. Hamachi VPN consists of a centralized server cluster managed by LogMeIn and the Hamachi client software, which is installed on end-user computers. 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Hamachi client first authenticates to the LogMeIn server to setup a direct, encrypted connection between clients. The Hamachi client software works by adding a virtual network interface to the local host, which is used for intercepting outbound and injecting inbound VPN traffic. Outbound traffic sent by the local host to this interface is delivered to the client software, which encrypts, authenticates, and sends it to the destination VPN peer over a specially initiated UDP connection. The client exhibits evasive behavior by first detecting whether or not there is a firewall or NAT device en route to the Internet. Then when establishing tunnels between peers, Hamachi uses a server-assisted NAT-traversal technique, similar to UDP hole punching.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It used to be that setting up a VPN tunnel was extremely difficult, however with Hamachi VPN, a VPN tunnel can be established in less than 10 minutes. Hamachi VPN is challenging for most enterprise networks because of its ease of use, evasive behavior, and the lack of visibility and control over what is running inside the encrypted tunnels. In order to mitigate risks and enforce safe Internet usage policies, Enterprises should maintain visibility and control over applications like Hamachi VPN.</analysis>

                    <description>The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a host identification technology for use on Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. The Internet has two main name spaces, IP addresses and the Domain Name System. HIP separates the end-point identifier and locator roles of IP addresses. It introduces a Host Identity (HI) name space, based on a public key security infrastructure.</description>

                    <description>Secure Client Solution protects the client environment by means of an elaborate system consisting of a diskless thin client "Security PC" that cannot store information and a user authentication device called "KeyMobile." This solution implements a mechanism called "screen transfer type" that sends only the data entered from a keyboard and mouse to the in-house system via the network and transfers and displays processing screens of applications associated with the entered data to the client device.

                    <description>The http-nsri application is a special App-ID that denotes HTTP traffic with “no server response inspection.” Traffic will be identified as http-nsri only when it is used in an application override policy together with the DSRI (disable server response inspection) option in security policy.
When the DSRI option is applied to any HTTP-based App-ID, inspection for server response in each HTTP transaction is disabled only after sufficient data has been inspected to identify other applications running over the protocol. 
However, when the DSRI option is applied to the “http-nsri” application, content inspection is skipped for the entire server response. It is recommended for use in environments where the typical HTTP session has small transactions and content inspection is required for HTTP requests only.</description>

                    <description>HTTPort creates a transparent tunnel through a proxy server or firewall. This allows users to use all sorts of Internet software from behind the proxy. It bypasses HTTPS and HTTP proxies, transparent accelerators, and firewalls. It has a built-in SOCKS4 server.</description>

                    <description>Hulu is an online video on demand service offering streaming video of TV shows and movies, primarily from NBC and FOX and their cable networks. Hulu has online social networking features, allowing users to clip videos, or parts of videos, from the site for posting in outside online communities. (Hulu has called this aspect video sharing, though users cannot upload content.) Hulu videos are currently offered only to users in the United States. </description>
                    <analysis>Hulu Networks is a perfect example of an entertainment application used at work. Hulu is the self-proclaimed leader in cerebral gelatinizing high definition TV over the web. Hulu uses Flash to deliver a limited set of movies along with TV and cable shows from NBC and Fox. Unlike applications such as YouTube, which can enable posting of work-related videos, Hulu is broadcast only – and as such, it is unlikely that it is being used for work. Users can however embed video clips into social networking sites and online communities, using code samples provided by Hulu. In terms of delineating Hulu content from generic Flash, Palo Alto Networks identifies the unique characteristics that Hulu exhibits, enabling administrators to set a policy that allows Flash yet controls Hulu and other video sites like it. </analysis>

                    <description>Hushmail is a web-based email service offering PGP-encrypted e-mail, file storage, vanity domain service, and instant messaging (Hush Messenger). Hushmail uses OpenPGP standards and the source is available for download. Additional security features include hidden IP addresses in e-mail headers. The free e-mail account has a limit of 2MB, and no IMAP or POP3. Paid accounts have several hundred MB of storage as well as IMAP and POP3 access. If public encryption keys are available to both recipient and sender (either both are Hushmail users or have uploaded PGP keys to the Hush keyserver), Hushmail can convey authenticated, encrypted messages in both directions. For recipients for whom no public key is available, Hushmail will allow a message to be encrypted by a password (with a password hint) and stored for pickup by the recipient, or the message can be sent in cleartext.</description>

                    <description>Hyves is a free Dutch social networking site which has been online since October 2004. The site was launched by Raymond Spanjar, Koen Kam and Floris Rost van Tonningen. The name Hyves comes from the English Beehive - not from Hives, hereby comparing the users to bees in a hyve. Since the domain hives.nl was already registered, they chose to call their website Hyves.
The focus of this website is on keeping in touch with existing friends and making new friends. There is no need to have knowledge of HTML for creating a Hyve. It is comparable with other social networking sites. Users can create personalized pages of themselves with rich media content, such as photos, videos, flash content and custom layouts.

In July 2008 Hyves announced that they had reached 7 million users, of which about 5 million were Dutch. This amounts to about a third of the entire population of The Netherlands. In 2007, the website was voted "most popular website of the year" in the "Website of the year" competition. In 2006 and 2007 Hyves also won another "Website of the year" competition in the category for blogs and communities.</description>

                    <description>Rational ClearCase is a software tool for revision control (e.g. configuration management, SCM) of source code and other software development assets. It is developed by the Rational Software division of IBM. ClearCase forms the base of version control for many large and medium sized businesses and can handle projects with hundreds or thousands of developers.

ClearCase supports two kinds of use models, UCM, and base ClearCase. UCM provides an out-of-the-box model while base ClearCase provides a basic infrastructure (upon which UCM is built) which allows for more flexibility. Both can be configured to support a wide variety of needs.
ClearCase can run on a number of platforms including AIX, z/OS, Linux, HP-UX, Solaris and Windows. It can handle large binary files, large numbers of files, and large repository sizes. It handles branching, labeling, and versioning of directories.</description>

                    <description>IBM Director is an element management system (EMS) (sometimes referred to as a "workgroup management system") first introduced by IBM in 1993 as NetFinity Manager. The software was originally written to run on OS/2 2.0. It has subsequently gone through a number of name changes in the interim. It was changed in 1996 to IBM PC SystemView. Later that same year, it was renamed to TME 10 NetFinity. The following year, it reverted to a slightly altered version of its original name: IBM Netfinity Manager (note the lowercase 'f').

In 1999, IBM announced Netfinity Director; a new product based on Tivoli IT Director. It was intended as a replacement for IBM Netfinity Manager. When IBM renamed its Netfinity line of enterprise servers to xSeries, the name was changed to IBM Director.

IBM Director consists of 3 components: an agent, a console and a server. To take full advantage of IBM Director's capabilities, the IBM Director Agent must be installed on the monitored system. Inventory and management data are stored in an SQL database (Oracle, SQL Server, IBM DB2 Universal Database or PostgreSQL) which can be separate or on the same server where IBM Director Server resides. Smaller deployments can also utilize Microsoft's Jet or MSDE. The server is configured and managed using the IBM Director Console from any Linux or Microsoft Windows workstation.</description>

                    <description>IBM WebSphere MQ is a family of network communication software products launched by IBM in March 1992. It was previously known as MQSeries, a trademark that IBM rebranded in 2002 to join the suite of WebSphere products. WebSphere MQ, which is often referred to simply as "MQ" by users, is IBM's Message Oriented Middleware offering. It allows independent and potentially non-concurrent applications on a distributed system to communicate with each other. MQ is available on a large number of platforms (both IBM and non-IBM), including z/OS (mainframe), OS/400 (IBM System i or AS/400), Transaction Processing Facility, UNIX (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris), HP NonStop, OpenVMS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.</description>

                    <description>The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) is a lightweight HTTP based protocol specified in RFC 3507 designed to off-load specific content to dedicated servers, thereby freeing up resources and standardizing the way in which features are implemented. ICAP is generally used in proxy servers to integrate with third party products like antivirus software, malicious content scanners and URL filters.

ICAP in its most basic form is a "lightweight" HTTP based remote procedure call protocol. In other words, ICAP allows its clients to pass HTTP based (HTML) messages (Content) to ICAP servers for adaptation. Adaptation refers to performing the particular value added service (content manipulation) for the associated client request/response.

ICAP concentrates on leveraging edge-based devices (proxies and caches) to help deliver value-added services. At the core of this process is a cache that will proxy all client transactions and will process them through ICAP Web servers. These ICAP servers are focused on a specific function, for example, ad insertion, virus scanning, content translation, language translation, or content filtering. Off-loading value-added services from Web servers to ICAP servers allows those same web servers to be scaled according to raw HTTP throughput versus having to handle these extra tasks. </description>

                    <description>International Electrotechnical Commission 60870 standards define systems used for telecontrol (supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA). Such systems are used for controlling electric power transmission grids and other geographically widespread control systems. By use of standardized protocols, equipment from many different suppliers can be made to interoperate. IEC standard 60870 has six parts, defining general information related to the standard, operating conditions, electrical interfaces, performance requirements, and data transmission protocols. IEC 60870-5-104 enables communication between control station and substation via a standard TCP/IP network.</description>

                    <description>iFolder is an open source application, developed by Novell, Inc., intended to allow cross-platform file sharing across computer networks. iFolder operates on the concept of shared folders, where a folder is marked as shared and the contents of the folder are then synchronized to other computers over a network, either directly between computers in a peer-to-peer fashion or through a server. This is intended to allow a single user to synchronize files between different computers (for example between a work computer and a home computer) or share files with other users (for example a group of people who are collaborating on a project).

The core of the iFolder is actually a project called Simias. It is Simias which actually monitors files for changes, synchronizes these changes and controls the access permissions on folders. The actual iFolder clients (including a graphical desktop client and a web client) are developed as separate programs that communicate with the Simias back-end. </description>

                    <description>imeem is a service where users interact with each other by watching, posting, and sharing content of all media types, including blogs, photos, audio, and video. The company was founded by Dalton Calwell (ex-VA Linux) and Jan Jannink (formerly of Napster) and many of the core engineers came from the original Napster file sharing service[1]. Launched in October 2004,[2] the service has both a social network structure as well as a content browsing/filtering structure similar to that of Flickr and YouTube. It works on an advertising based business model, and is therefore free to use.</description>

                    <description>The technique of encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4 so that they can be carried across IPv4 routing infrastructures. While the IPv6 infrastructure is being deployed, the existing IPv4 routing infrastructure can remain functional and can be used to carry IPv6 traffic. Examples of IPv6 tunneling mechanisms are 6in4, 6to4.</description>

                    <description>The integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS) is a data grid that automates application of management policies. The system is based on a distributed client/server model . The federation of servers is implemented as peer-to-peer servers with a central metadata catalog managing persistent state information and a rule engine that applies rules stored in a rule base. Clients issue requests to the iRODS system to invoke rules controlling the execution of remote operations. For each client request, iRODS sends the client message to the remote server where the data reside, the requested operations are then performed, and the result is sent back to the client.</description>

                    <description>ISATAP (Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol) is an IPv6 transition mechanism meant to transmit IPv6 packets between dual-stack nodes on top of an IPv4 network. Contrary to 6over4 (an older similar protocol using IPv4 multicast), ISATAP uses IPv4 as a virtual nonbroadcast multiple-access network (NBMA) data link layer, so that it does not require the underlying IPv4 network infrastructure to support multicast.</description>

                    <description>In computing, iSCSI, is an abbreviation of Internet Small Computer System Interface, an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI is used to facilitate data transfers over intranets and to manage storage over long distances. iSCSI can be used to transmit data over local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet and can enable location-independent data storage and retrieval. The protocol allows clients (called initiators) to send SCSI commands (CDBs) to SCSI storage devices (targets) on remote servers. It is a popular storage area network (SAN) protocol, allowing organizations to consolidate storage into data center storage arrays while providing hosts (such as database and web servers) with the illusion of locally-attached disks. Unlike traditional Fibre Channel, which requires special-purpose cabling, iSCSI can be run over long distances using existing network infrastructure.</description>

                    <description>iTunes is a digital media player application, introduced by Apple Inc. on January 9, 2001, at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco. The application is used for playing and organizing digital music and video files. The program is also an interface to manage the contents on Apple's popular iPod digital media players as well as the iPhone. Additionally, iTunes can connect to the iTunes Store via the Internet to purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, iPod games, audiobooks, various podcasts, feature length films and Movie Rentals (available only in the USA, UK,Canada, Australia and New Zealand), and Ringtones (available only in the USA). Since July 11, 2008, there has also been the option to download apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch as long as they are running the 2.0 firmware released on the same date.

iTunes is available as a free download for Mac OS X, Windows Vista, and Windows XP from Apples website. It is also bundled with all Macs, and some HP and Dell computers. Older versions are available for Mac OS 9, OS X 10.0-10.2, and Windows 2000. Although Apple does not produce iTunes for other operating systems, it can, however, be run on Linux-based operating systems through Wine, a Windows compatibility layer.

A version of iTunes shipped with cell phones from Motorola, which included the ability to sync music from an iTunes library to the cellphone, as well as a similar interface between both platforms. Since the release of the iPhone, Apple has stopped distributing iTunes with other manufacturers phones in order to concentrate sales to Apples device.</description>

                    <analysis>ITV Player is an online video on demand service accessible though the main ITV website. Programmes are available for 30 days on the site after being first shown on ITV. The adverts cannot be skipped until you have seen the programme at least once. The service was originally called 'catch-up' but was then rebranded 'ITV Player' to give it a distinct proposition. All of ITV Studios' shows and the majority of independently produced shows feature on the service; however, sports, movies, imports and some other programmes with copyright issues don't - an example being The Bill. In addition to being available online it is also available on Virgin Media's on-demand service and BT Vision.</analysis>

                    <description>Joost (pronounced 'juiced') is a system for distributing TV shows and other forms of video over the Web using peer-to-peer TV technology, created by Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis (founders of Skype and Kazaa).</description>
                    <analysis>
Joost has the potential to bring about a real fusion of TV and the Internet.  Building on similar peer-to-peer technology used in Skype, Joost provides a new level of user experience for viewing TV content over the web in terms of viewing quality, social interaction, and ease of use.  Joost has established partnerships with content providers, like MTV, Warner Bros., and CNN, allowing a wide variety of video programs to be legally offered for free to Joost users.  We expect to see increased adoption and use of Joost as it moves toward official release. 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Joost's underlying technology leverages a distributed peer-to-peer architecture to deliver media streams to end users as opposed to centralized servers. The peer-to-peer network offers better scalability and lower latency on the streaming video content, and also provides firewall traversal and dynamic routing to evade corporate firewalls.  The Joost client provides social networking features that include integrated chat and instant messaging that lets users communicate with other users while watching Joost content. Public availability expected this summer.

                    <description>JXTA (Juxtapose) is an open source peer-to-peer protocol specification begun by Sun Microsystems in 2001. Sun remains actively involved in the development and promotion of JXTA. The JXTA protocols are defined as a set of XML messages which allow any device connected to a network to exchange messages and collaborate independently of the underlying network topology. JXTA is the most mature general purpose P2P framework currently available and was designed to allow a wide range of devices - PCs, mainframes, cell phones, PDAs - to communicate in a decentralized manner.

As JXTA is based upon a set of open XML protocols, it can be implemented in any modern computer language. Implementations are currently available for Java Platform, Standard Edition, C/C++/C# and J2ME. The C# Version uses the C++/C native bindings and is not a complete re-implementation in its own right.

JXTA peers create a virtual overlay network which allows a peer to interact with other peers even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and NATs or use different network transports. In addition, each resource is identified by a unique ID, a 160 bit SHA-1 URN in the Java binding, so that a peer can change its localization address while keeping a constant identification number.</description>

                    <description>Kaixin001 is a social networking website launched in March , 2008. In 2009, Kaixin001 ranks the 13th most popular website in China according to Alexa Internet.

Kaixin001's success can be partly credited to the Great Firewall of China. Due to the permanent blockage of other Social Networking Websites, such as Myspace, Facebook and Twitter since the summer of 2009, after the UrUmqi riots, many Chinese nationals turned to domestic sites, hence the membership spikes.</description>

                    <description>Kontiki is a peer-assisted content delivery technology company, founded in November 2000. It was acquired by VeriSign in March 2006. VeriSign as part of a major divestiture sold Kontiki to MK Capital in May 2008.

Kontiki is characterized as peer-assisted because it uses a combination of central servers and peer-to-peer communications. The Kontiki Delivery Manager provides the basis of many of the UKs video on demand services, including Sky Anytime, 4od and the BBC iPlayer.

Kontiki works using peer-assisted technology. Rather than the user downloading the entire television program from a central server, the Kontiki client combines pieces of the file downloaded from central servers with pieces of the file downloaded from other peers downloading the same content. Using this method the number of bits delivered from the central servers can be reduced, which can reduce cost. Additionally by leveraging other peers the system scales much more efficiently, and the more popular a piece of content is the more efficiently the system works. This is generally true for all peer-to-peer based systems.</description>

                    <description>Last.fm is a UK-based Internet radio and music community website, founded in 2002. It claims over 21 million active users based in more than 200 countries. On 30 May 2007, CBS Interactive acquired Last.fm for $280m USD.

Using a music recommendation system called "Audioscrobbler", Last.fm builds a detailed profile of each user's musical taste by recording details of all the songs the user listens to, either on the streamed radio stations, the user's computer or some portable music devices. This information is transferred to Last.fm's database ("scrobbled") via a plugin installed into the user's music player. The profile data is then displayed on the user's profile page. The site offers numerous social networking features and can recommend and play artists similar to the user's favourites.

Users can create custom radio stations and playlists from any of the audio tracks in Last.fm's music library, and are able to listen to some individual tracks on demand, or download tracks if the rights holder has previously authorised it. Registration, which is free, is required to acquire a profile but is not necessary to view any part of the site or to listen to radio stations.</description>

                    <description>LeapFILE is the industry-leading provider of on demand managed file transfer and collaboration solutions for businesses. Traditional methods of transferring files such as email attachments, courier services, and FTP sites do not adequately meet the needs of day-to-day business users. Email does not support large files, nor is it absolutely secure. Copying files to a CD or DVD and sending it via courier service can be time-consuming and expensive. FTP sites are complex to set-up, manage, and not user-friendly.

With LeapFILE, there are no email size limits, FTP hassles, or overnight delivery fees to deal with. LeapFILE is a web-hosted on-demand service so the solution can be implemented within minutes. Our core product is as easy to use as email for end users, and easy to deploy and manage by IT administrators. The success of LeapFILE lies in our product’s enterprise-grade yet user-friendly features, our uncompromising reliability and client support, and our web-based on demand model. Over 2,000 businesses worldwide depend on LeapFILE to manage their file transfer and file sharing needs.</description>

                    <description>Livestation is a platform for distributing live television and radio broadcasts over a peer-to-peer data network. It is being developed by Skinkers Ltd. based on peer-to-peer technology acquired from Microsoft Research.

Livestation uses a Silverlight front-end to playback broadcast streams, encoded in VC-1 format, received over a peer-to-peer overlay network. Playback controls are overlaid on top of the video stream. Unlike services such as Joost which offer video on demand channels, Livestation streams live broadcasts. Livestation splits a video stream into multiple stripes, each of which are shared independently among peers.

Current live TV news channels in the global offering (which comes with a default installation) are limited to France24 in English and French, Al Jazeera English, Russia Today and BBC World Service Radio. Otherwise, reception is limited through GeoIP filtering, and depends on the location of the receiver. Despite advertisement boasting BBC World News or EuroNews, these are not available in some locations, including but not limited to the United States. Livestation viewers can add channels from a directory, and may add their own choice of channels to the directory (limited to Windows Media streams).

                    <description>LogMeIn is a suite of software services that provides remote access to computers over the Internet. The various product versions are designed for both end users and professional help desk personnel.

LogMeIn remote access products use a proprietary remote desktop protocol that is transmitted via SSL. An SSL certificate is created for each remote desktop and is used for cryptographically secure communications between the remote desktop and the accessing computer.

Users access remote desktops using an Internet-based web portal and, optionally, the LogMeIn Ignition stand-alone application. The portal also provides status information for the remote computers and, optionally, remote computer management functions.

The service connects the remote desktop and the local computer using SSL over TCP or UDP and utilizing NAT Traversal techniques to achieve peer-to-peer connectivity when available.</description>

                    <description>MegaVideo is a video sharing website based in Hong Kong run by the creators of Megaupload,it is one of the 100 most visited websites in the United States. The website officially claims to aim replacing YouTube as the leader in online video.

Unlike YouTube, MegaVideo require users to pay lot of money and with a slow moderating action which allows for copyrighted material to be online for long periods. MegaVideo survives due to its strong ties to advertising. Recently, MegaVideo has enforced a policy of limiting guest users so that they can only watch short periods of video without becoming a paying member. Registration is optional. It is not needed to watch videos, but to upload videos registration is required. Visitors can watch up to 72 minutes of video every 55 minutes. They must then wait 55 minutes before watching for another 72 minutes. Unlimited viewing is a part of the MegaVideo premium service.

                    <description>Mercurial is a cross-platform, distributed revision control tool for software developers. It is mainly implemented using the Python programming language, but includes a binary diff implementation written in C. Mercurial was initially written to run on Linux. It has been ported to Windows, Mac OS X, and most other Unix-like systems. Mercurial is primarily a command line program. All of Mercurial's operations are invoked as keyword options to its driver program hg, a reference to the chemical symbol of the element mercury.

Mercurial's major design goals include high performance and scalability, decentralized, fully distributed collaborative development, robust handling of both plain text and binary files, and advanced branching and merging capabilities, while remaining conceptually simple. It includes an integrated web interface.

The creator and lead developer of Mercurial is Matt Mackall. The source code is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, qualifying Mercurial as free software.</description>

                    <description>Mibbit is a web-based client for modern web browsers that supports Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Yahoo Messenger, and Twitter. It is developed by Jimmy Moore and is designed around the Ajax model with a user interface written in JavaScript.

Mibbit's user interface operates entirely within a web browser and does not require installation of any software on the user's computer. Most modern web browsers that support recent versions of JavaScript are supported, including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Google Chrome, and Safari. Mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone iPod Touch, and Nokia N800, and other platforms such as the Nintendo Wii are also supported.

Unlike typical web-based IRC clients, Mibbit makes use of a client-server design model. The user interface is written in HTML and JavaScript using Ajax programming techniques. The client's backend is written completely in Java and operates independently of the web server in a standalone fashion on the Mibbit server. This design differs from web browser component clients such as ChatZilla or Java applet based IRC clients such as PJIRC that operate entirely from within the web browser. It also differs from server-based web proxy IRC clients such as CGI:IRC where all processing takes place on a remote server.

Because the client-server design allows for a centralized Mibbit client server, Mibbit is able to offer extended functionality which is not present in the standard IRC protocol. Some of these extensions include a channel chat buffer that can be shown to Mibbit clients when they join a channel where another Mibbit user is already present, a notification for other Mibbit users that you are typing a message to them, and distinctive icons that allow identification of the device used with Mibbit such as an iPhone, iPod Touch, Wii, etc.

Mibbit supports the webirc (cgiirc) protocol which allows the client to send the user's IP address and hostname to the IRC server. Servers that support webirc allow Mibbit users to appear as regular IRC clients instead of appearing to connect from the mibbit.com domain. If webirc is not used or is unavailable, Mibbit puts the user's hostname in the client's realname field and encodes the user's IP address in hexadecimal and sends it as the ident reply.</description>

                    <description>Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a multi-lingual Customer Relationship Management software package developed by Microsoft. Out of the box, the product focuses mainly on Sales, Marketing and Service (helpdesk) sectors but Microsoft has been marketing Dynamics CRM as an XRM platform and have been encouraging partners to use its proprietary (but .NET based) framework to customise it to meet many different demands.
It is a part of the Microsoft Dynamics family of business applications which include other products such as Microsoft Dynamics AX (ERP application), Microsoft Dynamics GP, (ERP application) Microsoft Dynamics NAV (ERP application) and Microsoft Dynamics SL (ERP Application).

Dynamics CRM is a server-client application which, like Microsoft SharePoint is primarily an IIS-based web application which has extensive web services interfaces. Clients access Dynamics CRM either by using Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 or later web browser or by a thick client plug-in to Microsoft Outlook. While other browsers may be used to access Dynamics, results can be mixed and are not supported by Microsoft.
The current version of Microsoft Dynamics CRM is 4.0 (Update Rollup 9 - 4.00.7333.2644 - Release Date 11 Feb. 2010)</description>

                    <description>The product began as a network management system called SeNTry ELM, which was developed by the British company Serverware Group plc. In June 1998 the intellectual property rights were bought by Mission Critical Software, inc,[1] who renamed the product Enterprise Event Manager. Mission Critical Software merged with NetIQ in early 2000, and sold the rights to the product to Microsoft in October 2000. System Center Operations Manager 2007 was designed from a fresh code base, and although sharing similarities to Microsoft Operations Manager, is not an upgrade from the previous versions.

The basic idea is to place a piece of software, an agent, on the computer to be monitored. The agent watches several sources on that computer, including the Windows Event Log, for specific events or alerts generated by the applications executing on the monitored computer. Upon alert occurrence and detection, the agent forwards the alert to a central SCOM server. This SCOM server application maintains a database that includes a history of alerts. The SCOM server applies filtering rules to alerts as they arrive; a rule can trigger some notification to a human, such as an e-mail or a pager message, generate a network support ticket, or trigger some other workflow intended to correct the cause of the alert in an appropriate manner.

SCOM uses the term management pack to refer to a set of filtering rules specific to some monitored application. While Microsoft and other software vendors make management packages available for their products, SCOM also provides for authoring custom management packs. While an administrator role is needed to install agents, configure monitored computers and create management packs, rights to simply view the list of recent alerts can be given to any valid user account.
Several SCOM servers can be aggregated together to monitor multiple networks across logical Windows domain and physical network boundaries. Through a connector framework scheme employing a web service, individual SCOM servers can exchange alerts with other network management applications.</description>

                    <description>Microsoft Media Services was Microsoft's proprietary network streaming protocol used to transfer unicast data in Windows Media Services (previously called NetShow Services). MMS can be transported via UDP or TCP.

Microsoft deprecated MMS in favor of RTSP in 2003 with the release of the Windows Media Services 9 Series, but continued to support the MMS for some time in the interest of backwards compatibility. Support for the protocol was finally dropped in Windows Media Services 2008.

As part of protocol rollover a Windows Media Player 11 client opening an "mms://" URL will attempt to connect first with RTSP over UDP and if that fails it will attempt RTSP over TCP. Earlier Windows Media Player clients as well as version 11 after having failed RTSP will attempt MMS over UDP, then MMS over TCP. If MMS fails a modified version of a HTTP over TCP connection will be attempted, this modified version is also referred to as MMSH.</description>

                    <description>NetMotion's primary product is Mobility XE, a Mobile VPN for mobile workers who use computing devices. It secures, maintains and optimizes data connections for these workers as they move in and out of wireless coverage areas and roam between networks. Mobility XE is used by more than 1,600 organizations including public utilities, healthcare institutions, communications providers, field service organizations, insurance companies, public safety organizations, transportation companies and many others. 

The essential functionality of the product is its ability to keep workers continuously logged in, and their network connections and application sessions alive as they encounter coverage gaps and cross network boundaries. It also includes management features that give administrators visibility and control over those mobile devices.</description>

                    <description>The Motley Fool is a commercial website about stocks, investing, and personal finance. The Alexandria, Virginia-based private company was founded in July 1993 by co-chairmen and brothers David and Tom Gardner, and Erik Rydholm, who has since left. The company employs approximately 200 people.

The Motley Fool hosts on-line discussion boards for the purpose of helping people make better financial decisions. Registered users can get access to all non-newsletter boards that cover a variety of stock, personal finance, and investing concepts. The discussion boards are used heavily to recruit future Motley Fool staffers, with frequent posters first awarded free subscriptions to their favorite newsletters, to eventually receiving a small stipend and "TMF" username moniker to patrol the boards.

                    <description>MQTT stands for Message Queue Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. The design principles are to minimize network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery. The “SCADA protocol” and the “MQ Integrator SCADA Device Protocol” (MQIsdp) are both old names for what is now known as the MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT). The protocol has also been known as “WebSphere MQTT” (WMQTT), though that name is also no longer used.</description>

                    <description>Microsoft Firewall Client for ISA Server provides enhanced security, application support, and access control for client computers. When a client computer running Firewall Client for ISA Server makes a request, the destination is evaluated by the Firewall Client software, and external requests are directed to the ISA Server computer for handling. Firewall Client sends user information transparently with each request, enabling you to create a firewall policy on the ISA Server computer with rules that use the authentication credentials presented by the client.</description>

                    <description>Microsoft Key Management Service (KMS) activates computers on a local network, eliminating the need for individual computers to connect to Microsoft. To do this, KMS uses a client–server topology. KMS client computers can locate KMS host computers by using Domain Name System (DNS) or a static configuration. KMS clients contact the KMS host by using remote procedure call (RPC). KMS can be hosted on computers that are running the Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2 operating systems.</description>

                    <description>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a multi-channel protocol that allows a user to connect to a networked computer. Clients exist for most versions of Windows (including handheld versions), Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and other modern operating systems. The server listens by default on TCP port 3389. Microsoft refers to the official RDP server software as Terminal Services or Remote Desktop Services. The official client software is referred to as either Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) or Terminal Services Client (TSC). Mac OS X's client is called Apple Remote Desktop (ARD).  </description>
                    <analysis>With RDP, an employee can easily configure their work PC to connect to their home PC and from there can, run any application they desire - swap files, run a P2P application, listen to music, surf the web - all in a tunnel that can be encrypted with RC4, although it is known to be susceptible to man-in-the middle vulnerabilities. </analysis>

                    <description>Microsoft Task Scheduler service enables you to perform automated tasks on a computer. With this service, you can schedule any program to run at any time or when a specific event occurs. The Task Scheduler monitors the time or event criteria that you choose and then executes the task when those criteria are met. The AT command-line tool communicates with the task scheduler service to schedule commands and programs to run on a remote computer at a specified time and date. </description>

                    <description>Windows Live Messenger (formerly named MSN Messenger) is an instant messaging client created by Microsoft to work with Windows XP (up to Wave 3), Windows Vista (up to Wave 4), Windows 7, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, Windows CE, Xbox 360, Blackberry OS, iOS, Java ME, S60 on Symbian OS 9.x, and Zune HD. The client has been part of Microsoft's Windows Live set of online services since 2005. It connects to Microsoft Messenger service. The client was first released as MSN Messenger on July 22, 1999, and as Windows Live Messenger on December 13, 2005. In June 2009, Microsoft reported the service attracted over 330 million active users each month.

On November 6, 2012, Microsoft announced that Windows Live Messenger will be retired (except in mainland China) in favor of Skype. The function allowing users to merge their Skype accounts with Microsoft account was introduced, allowing them to communicate with their Messenger contacts via the Skype clients. Microsoft will begin the transition for all users from April 8, 2013.</description>

                    <description>NEOnet is a distributed hash table peer-to-peer network created by the makers of Morpheus, StreamCast Networks. Morpheus is the primary client used on the NEOnet network. </description>
                    <analysis>NEOnet (also known as NEO Networks) is a decentralized peer-to-peer network formed by Morpheus users.  Morpheus is a peer-to-peer client software that implements NEOnets technology for distributed file sharing. NEOnet was the first peer-to-peer technology to introduce DHT (distributed hash table), which allows efficient file distribution and sharing among a large number of peers. Today, NEOnet networks claims to have a simultaneous user population of 7 million and growing. 

&amp;lt;br/&gt;

&amp;lt;br/&gt;

In contrast to peer-to-peer technologies like Gnutella and FastTrack, NEOnet does not have servers or superpeers which can quickly become performance bottlenecks with large networks. NEOnet uses the DHT technology to dynamically distribute and search files among all the peers in the network, allowing completely decentralized and server-less operation. The development of the core DHT technology began in 2001 with a group of computer science alumni from Harvard University that eventually evolved into the NEOnet technology, which can be used to build efficient content distribution networks for use in other areas beside peer-to-peer networks.</analysis>

The company has more than 55 million discs and, on average, ships 1.9 million DVDs to customers each day. Netflix previously claimed to spend about $300 million a year on postage.

                    <description>The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an Internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate. It was created as an alternative to certificate revocation lists (CRL), specifically addressing certain problems associated with using CRLs in a public key infrastructure (PKI).

                    <description>Octoshape is a peer to peer streaming media server and client which uses peer to peer grid technology to minimize the bandwidth for any broadcaster to stream any material. 

Octoshape can be used to multicast stream audio (Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WMA) and/or video (MPEG-4, VP3, or WMV and other codecs), or any other stream of data, over the internet. Octoshape uses peer-to-peer grid-distributed bandwidth to minimize the load on the broadcaster's bandwidth. The intention is that each listener will relay either part or all of the stream they download to several other nodes in the grid. The makers of Octoshape hope that sound and video will continue to play without interruption when peers log off.</description>

                    <description>Microsoft Office Live is a set of Internet-based services designed for consumers and small businesses interested in creating a website or storing and sharing documents online. As of 2009, it consists of two services, Office Live Workspace and Office Live Small Business.

Office Live Workspace is a free service for storing and sharing documents online. It is most commonly used for work, school, and home projects, allowing users to manage their documents from remote locations, alleviating the need for flash drives. Workspaces can be accessed directly from Office Word, Excel and PowerPoint by installing an Office Live Update. Files can't be edited from within workspace, but clicking on "edit" will open them up in Microsoft Office. The workspace doesn't offer offline collaboration — instead documents are "checked out" and "checked in," but the service does integrate with SharedView for real-time screen sharing.</description>

                    <description>OLE for Process Control (OPC), which stands for Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control, is the original name for a standards specification developed in 1996 by an industrial automation industry task force and used in SCADA networks. The standard specifies the communication of real-time plant data between control devices from different manufacturers. As of November 2011, the OPC Foundation has officially renamed the acronym to mean "Open Platform Communications".</description>

                    <description>Opera Mini is a web browser designed primarily for mobile phones, smartphones and personal digital assistants. Opera Mini requests web pages through Opera Software's proxy servers, which process and compress them before sending them to the mobile phone, speeding up transfer by two to three times and dramatically reducing the amount of data transferred, chargeable on many mobile phone data plans. The pre-processing increases compatibility with web pages not designed for mobile phones.</description>

                    <description>Oracle Forms is a software product for creating screens that interact with an Oracle database. It has an IDE including an object navigator, property sheet and code editor that uses PL/SQL. It was originally developed to run server-side in character mode terminal sessions. It was ported to other platforms, including Windows, to function in a client server environment. Later versions were ported to Java where it runs in a Java EE container and can integrate with Java and web services. The primary focus of Forms is to create data entry systems that access an Oracle database.</description>

                    <description>Orkut is a social networking service which is run by Google and named after its creator, an employee of Google - Orkut . The service states that it was designed to help users meet new friends and maintain existing relationships. Similar to Facebook, Friendster and MySpace, Orkut goes a step further by permitting the creation of easy-to-set-up simple forums (called "communities") of users. Since October 2006, Orkut has permitted users to create accounts without an invitation. Orkut is the most visited website in India and 2nd most visited site in Brazil. The initial target market for orkut was the United States, but the majority of its users are in India and Brazil. In fact, as of March 2008, 67.5% of the traffic comes from Brazil, followed by 15.4%, which comes from India. </description>

                    <description>OSSEC is a free, open source host-based intrusion detection system. It performs log analysis, integrity checking, Windows registry monitoring, rootkit detection, time-based alerting and active response. It provides intrusion detection for most operating systems, including Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows. It has a centralized, cross-platform architecture allowing multiple systems to be easily monitored and managed.

In June 2008 the OSSEC project and all the copyright owned by the project leader, Daniel B. Cid, were acquired by Third Brigade, Inc. They promised to continue to contribute to the open source community and extend commercial support and training to the OSSEC open source community.

In May 2009 Trend Micro acquired Third Brigade and the OSSEC project, with promises to keep it open source and free.</description>

Contrary to older VPN solutions, PacketiX VPN 2.0 can be integrated into an existing network much more easily, as it creates a virtual image of an Ethernet, with LAN cards, routers, hubs and switches. The PacketiX VPN protocol easily passes obstacles on the LAN and the Internet, like firewalls and proxies, as its packets can be handled like a usual SSL connection.</description>

                    <description>Palringo is a server-based instant messaging client for various platforms. It supports various protocols such as AIM, Yahoo!, MSN, XMPP, Google Talk, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ, Facebook IM.

Palringo uses a proprietary protocol that allows communication between other Palringo users. This protocol also allows communication between the IM servers and the Palringo client, as the Palringo client does not directly talk to any of the IM protocols. Newer versions of the Palringo protocol allow basic features in most IM services such as status messages and online statuses.

Palringo offers a technology, Palringo Local, which allows users to set and view peers location VIA manual setting, GPS, Triangulation, or estimation over the current internet network. It uses the Google Maps API to display peer locations, and also offers a "Nearby" section in group and friend lists to show nearby users.</description>

                    <description>Keeping ease of use and consistency as key development goals, the web interfaces for both Panorama and the individual platforms have the same look and feel, thereby minimizing the learning curve often associated with switching from single-device management to centralized management of multiple next generation firewalls. The Palo Alto Networks management tools make security policy management a straightforward process, using visualization tools, common application names and standard security terminology.</description>

                    <description>Paradise Paintball is the world's first "Social Shooter". It offers both single and multiplayer first-person shooter experiences and can be played across most internet browsers, in Macintosh or Windows and via Facebook, MySpace or Apple Dashboard. Single player features are only present during practice sessions. Paradise Paintball is thought to be the first 3D browser based game with real time micropayment systems, where users will be able to purchase virtual goods or top up on credits without having to quit the game.
Paradise Paintball was one of the very first applications to be verified by Facebook with the video preview of the game shown in Facebook's promotional video. It was also one of the few gaming applications that was selected for the video. The game had more than 100% and 500% growth in monthly active users in the past month and past three months respectively on Facebook.</description>

                    <description>PCoIP is a display compression technology from Teradici for connecting desktops over existing, standard IP networks. PCoIP technology allows all enterprise desktops, to be centrally located and managed in the data center, while providing the remote user with an exceptional user experience. The PCoIP protocol compresses, encrypts and encodes the entire computing experience at the data center and transmits it ‘pixels only’ across any standard IP network to stateless PCoIP zero clients. Your data never leaves the data center. The PCoIP protocol is implemented in silicon for hardware accelerated performance, and in software in VMware View. It supports high resolution, full frame rate 3D graphics and HD media, multiple large displays, full USB peripheral connectivity, and high definition audio, all connected over the corporate LAN or WAN.</description>

                    <description>PHProxy acts as a protective screener between the user and the internet. The server downloads the page into its memory, and then displays it to the user. From the point-of-view (in the technical sense) of the host hosting the target site, only the server visited. This means only the server's IP will be logged, and not the user's. Blocking of sites by ISPs and firewalls will not work as well, as the user is basically accessing the proxy. However, the catch here is that the server must be able to access these resources. </description>

                    <description>A Phweet is a shortURL that makes conversations and conference calls possible between Twitter friends and across other social networks. Phweet lets you accept calls with one click from your Twitter page or Twitter clients.  Phweet is a simple service where you don't need to download or share anything more to talk. The call is contained within a PhweetUrl;  a smart link that calls you. You can send or receive a Phweet on the web, on a SIP phone, or on your mobile phone.  And you can share who you are talking to in real time without having to reveal or exchange phone numbers or other identities.

                    <description>Ping is a computer network tool used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network; it is also used to self test the network interface card of the computer. It works by sending ICMP echo request packets to the target host and listening for ICMP echo response replies. Ping estimates the round-trip time, generally in milliseconds, and records any packet loss, and prints a statistical summary when finished. </description>

                    <description>Plaxo is an online address book and social networking service founded by Napster co-founder Sean Parker, Minh Nguyen and two Stanford engineering students, Todd Masonis and Cameron Ring. Plaxo, based in Mountain View, California, is currently privately held and supported by venture capital including funds from Sequoia Capital. On May 14, 2008, Plaxo reported it had signed an agreement to be acquired by Comcast. Plaxo did not disclose the terms of the deal. In May 2008, the website reported 20 million users. 
 
Plaxo provides automatic updating of contact information. Users and their contacts store their information on Plaxo's servers. When this information is edited by the user, the changes appear in the address books of all those who listed the account changer in their own books. Once contacts are stored in the central location, it is possible to list connections between contacts and access the address book from anywhere. </description>

                    <description>Pogo.com is a popular gaming website that offers a variety of free casual games, from card and board games to puzzle, word, and sports games. The website is free, due to advertising sponsorships. Players can also sign up for Club Pogo, a subscription service that includes premium benefits and does not include advertisements.

Players can win jackpot prizes and tokens from playing the games on Pogo.com. Tokens can then be exchanged for tickets in daily, weekly, or monthly prize drawings. Players can place bets of tokens on some games, such as Texas hold 'em poker and High Stakes poker. Cash and merchandise prizes are available to U.S. and Canadian residents, excluding Quebec. Players in the UK can win merchandise prizes. 

Pogo also offers downloadable games, often "deluxe" or "to go" versions of already-released games, which can be bought and played while offline. Some of these downloadable games include chat and tokens, similar to the original games.

Since 2006, Pogo.com has consistently been a top-10 Internet site for U.S. visitors when measured by time spent online.</description>

                    <description>PokerStars is the largest online poker cardroom in the world. PokerStars overtook PartyPoker as the world's largest online poker room at around the time the U.S. Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. Many sites, including PartyPoker, immediately suspended business with U.S. gamblers, while others, including PokerStars, did not. On May 19th 2007, PokerStars dealt their 10,000,000,000th hand.</description>

                    <description>Psiphon is a web proxy designed to help Internet users affected by Internet censorship securely bypass content-filtering systems set up by governments such as Australia, China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Thailand, Saudi Arabia and others. Psiphon was developed by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, building upon previous generations of web proxy software systems, such as the "SafeWeb" and "Anonymizer" systems.

Psiphon's recommended use is among private, trusted relationships that span censored and uncensored locations (such as those that exist among friends and family members, for example) rather than as an open public proxy. Traffic between clients and servers in the Psiphon system is encrypted using the https protocol.</description>

                    <description>EasyInstall is a package manager for the Python programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Python programs and libraries (based on the Python Eggs wrapper). easy_install is a module bundled with setuptools, a third-party library meant to enhance the Python standard library's distutils (Distribution utilities). It is analogous to RubyGems for the Ruby programming language. By default, EasyInstall looks in the Python Package Index (PyPI) for the desired packages and uses the metadata there to download and install the package and its dependencies. It is also hosted itself on the PyPI.</description>

                    <description>QQ Games is a casual games client, offering only multi-player online games. Games are available through the QQ Games client and are entirely free to play. Partnering with AOL Instant Messenger through the AIM Plugin Gallery, AIM version 6.5 and up comes bundled with QQ Games. While formerly linked to AIM in such a way that an AIM screename was required to play, QQ Game now offers its own account registration.

QQ Games is distinct in the US casual gaming sphere in the fact that it is one of the few services that offer a game hall experience, which combines community elements such as profiles, chat, and friends list, with exclusively multiplayer versions of the typical casual game contenders.

QQ Games is created by Tencent America, LLC., a part of the Tencent group, headquartered in Redwood City, CA.</description>

                    <description>reDuh is a tool that can be used to create a TCP circuit through validly formed HTTP requests. Essentially this means if JSP/PHP/ASP page can be uploaded to a server, it can connect to hosts behind that server trivially.

                    <description>Regnum Online is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by NGD Studios, a game development studio located in Argentina. In addition to usual character development present in other games of the genre, the game focuses on the conflict of 3 realms in which players take part, fighting against characters of opposing factions and capturing fortresses and castles aside from the usual player vs monster combats.

The name Regnum means realm in Latin, and is also a tribute to one of the first games ever published in Argentina by some of the team members (which was named Regnum). It is frequently abbreviated as RO or ROL (which in Spanish also means role, as in role-playing games). The game was officially released May 24, 2007.

The game has currently more than 500,000 subscriptions and has received reviews in local newspapers, TV programs and in game-related websites (see External Links), as well as international sites spread throughout the world.

NGD studios made a contract with Gamigo, a German gaming company and opened a German Server. Soon after, NGD added another German server to meet the demand for the game. In 2009 UnitedGames gained the exclusive rights for the Netherlands and Belgium and a new server, Tyr, was opened, with Dutch as official language. However Tyr has been shutdown by UnitedGames and players database has been merged with the English server.</description>

                    <description>StreamBase Adapter for Reuters SFC, which allows StreamBase to communicate with Reuters RMDS, TIB and Triarch market data systems. This adapter only supports consuming Reuters data, not publishing back to the Reuters system. The Reuters SFC adapter is used to connect one Reuters service to one StreamBase server. A single instance of the adapter can subscribe to many Reuters subjects and publish to multiple StreamBase input streams. But to connect multiple Reuters services or multiple StreamBase servers one must run multiple instances of the Reuters adapter.</description>

                    <description>The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a standardized computer system interface used by system administrators for out-of-band management of computer systems and monitoring of their operation. Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) bus or bridge may be managed with the Remote Management Control Protocol (RMCP), a specialized wire protocol. RMCP+ (a UDP-based protocol with stronger authentication than RMCP) is used for IPMI over LAN.</description>

                    <description>'RMI-IIOP' (read as "RMI over IIOP") denotes the Java remote method invocation (RMI) interface over the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP), which delivers Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) distributed computing capabilities to the Java 2 platform. Java RMI-IIOP was developed by Sun Microsystems and IBM, combining features of Java RMI technology with features of CORBA technology.

The Common Object Request Broker Architecture is a standard defined by the Object Management Group that enables software components written in multiple computer languages and running on multiple computers to work together, i.e. it supports multiple platforms.

On the other hand, the Remote Method Invocation API is a Java application programming interface that performs the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls, that is, allowing a computer program to cause a subroutine to execute on another computer on a shared network.</description>

                    <description>The HTTP protocol uses some new HTTP verbs to establish the HTTP tunnel to the RPC proxy server. The verbs could be RPC_IN_DATA or RPC_OUT_DATA, etc. This is also the feature of Exchange 2003 or 2007 and Outlook clients that allows a connection to an Exchange server, over the internet, to bypass some firewall restrictions.

                    <description>RSS is a family of web feed formats used to publish frequently updated
	 digital content, such as blogs, news feeds or podcasts.
     </description>
                    <analysis>
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an application for distributing text-based
content of blogs, news, or podcasts to their subscribers.  RSS feeds are a form
of web feeds, except that the feed contents are summaries with hyper links, and
are fetched from the servers automatically on the subscribers' behalf by RSS
readers. RSS readers are becoming a standard function of web browsers and other
client programs.  
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Transport of RSS feeds is done over HTTP.  The RSS feed format is XML-based but
detailed specifications are still evolving.  Enhancements are generally
introduced in order to better support multimedia content and to allow more
flexible processing by the readers. More and more security attacks are utilizing
RSS through social engineering where victims are served with malicious contents
disguised as things of interest.  RSS technology helps to automate the
distribution of any content, effectively increasing the attack vulnerability
window on our information infrastructure.  Therefore, effective monitoring and
control of RSS channels should be an important part of the security policy for
any enterprise.

                    <description>Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is a sister protocol of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). RTCP provides out-of-band control information for an RTP flow. It partners RTP in the delivery and packaging of multimedia data, but does not transport any data itself. It is used periodically to transmit control packets to participants in a streaming multimedia session. The primary function of RTCP is to provide feedback on the quality of service being provided by RTP.</description>

                    <description>Second Life (abbreviated as SL) is an Internet-based virtual world launched in 2003, developed by Linden Research, Inc (commonly referred to as Linden Lab), which came to international attention via mainstream news media in late 2006 and early 2007. A downloadable client program called the Second Life Viewer enables its users, called "Residents", to interact with each other through motional avatars, providing an advanced level of a social network service combined with general aspects of a metaverse. Residents can explore, meet other Residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, have virtual sex, and create and trade items (virtual property) and services from one another.  </description>

                    <description>This identifies voice chat traffic when using Second Life. Second Life is an online virtual world developed by Linden Lab which was launched on June 23, 2003. A number of free client programs called Viewers enable Second Life users, called Residents, to interact with each other through avatars. Residents can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another. Second Life is intended for people aged 13 and over, and as of 2011 has more than 20 million registered user accounts.</description>

                    <description>SecurityKISS Tunnel is the program and the service that allow you access Internet despite censorship and local restrictions. It also makes your connection secure and prevents others from viewing your web browsing activities, instant messages, downloads, credit card information or anything else you send over the network. Technically SecurityKISS Tunnel is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) implementation. It creates a VPN between your laptop and a security gateway so that all your Internet traffic goes through impenetrable, non-transparent tunnel.</description>

                    <description>Seesmic is a video blogging web application in alpha stage being developed by French entrepreneur Loic Le Meur to make video uploading easier for those using webcams. Seesmic made its debut at the Demo tech conference where it was called the "Twitter of video", however conversations will not take place in real time. The service has 20,000 users to date and 70,000 viewers per month.

LeMeur moved from Paris to San Francisco to launch Seesmic due to the perception that it would stand a better chance of success there. It is backed by a number of investors, the primary one being Atomico, a venture group that includes Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, who sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion.

On April 3, 2008, Seesmic announced that it had purchased Twhirl, an Adobe AIR based Twitter client.</description>

                    <description>The sFlow standard describes a mechanism to capture traffic data in switched or routed networks. It uses a sampling technology to collect statistics from the device and is, for this reason, applicable to high speed networks (at gigabit speeds or higher).

An sFlow agent is the implementation of the sampling mechanism on the hardware (for example a switch). The sFlow collector is a central server which collects the sFlow datagrams from all agents to store or (later) analyze them. The sFlow agent uses two forms of operation: statistical packet-based sampling of switched or routed packets, and time-based sampling of interface counters. sFlow specification (RFC 3176) and its first implementation were both launched in 2001.</description>

                    <description>Share is the name for a closed-source P2P application being developed in Japan by an anonymous author. Since the author of Winny was arrested, Share was developed as its successor, also focusing on higher security. Share functions in much the same manner as Winny, using encrypted caches, filenames and IP addresses, and is based on the same node organized architecture as Winny. </description>

                    <description>SharePoint is a portal-based collaboration and document management platform from Microsoft. It can be used to host web sites, termed SharePoint Portals, which can be used to access shared workspaces and documents, as well as specialized applications such as wikis and blogs, from within a browser. SharePoint functionality is exposed as web parts, which are components that implement a certain functionality, such as a task list, or discussion pane. These web parts are then composed into web pages, which are then hosted in the SharePoint portal. SharePoint sites are actually ASP.NET applications, which are served using IIS and use a SQL Server database as data storage backend.</description>
                    <analysis>The risks that SharePoint represent appear to be limited because it is a business application that is typically supported by IT. In reality, recent research by Neil MacDonald at Gartner shows that as many as 30% of the SharePoint deployments are rogue. A rogue SharePoint deployment is similar to the rogue wireless deployments of years ago. An improperly configured SharePoint deployment can provide an avenue for outbound data leakage and inbound threats or hackers.

                    <description>SharePoint is a portal-based collaboration and document management platform from Microsoft. It can be used to host web sites, termed SharePoint Portals, which can be used to access shared workspaces and documents, as well as specialized applications such as wikis and blogs, from within a browser. SharePoint functionality is exposed as web parts, which are components that implement a certain functionality, such as a task list, or discussion pane. These web parts are then composed into web pages, which are then hosted in the SharePoint portal. SharePoint sites are actually ASP.NET applications, which are served using IIS and use a SQL Server database as data storage backend.</description>

                    <description>The SHIM6 architecture defines SHIM6 Failure Detection and Locator Pair Exploration functions. The first is used to detect outages through the path defined by the current locator pair for a communication. To achieve this, hints provided by upper protocols such as TCP are used, or specific SHIM6 packet probes. The second function is used to determine valid locator pairs that could be used when an outage is detected.</description>

                    <description>SHOUTcast is a multiplatform freeware audio streaming technology, developed by Nullsoft. SHOUTcast uses MP3 or AAC encoding of audio content and HTTP (though multicast can be used) as the transport protocol to broadcast web radio, also known as Internet radio.</description>
                    <analysis>ShoutCast is a radio receiver for users to listen, but also enables a user to become a radio host. If a user is passionate about their music, or their political views, or just likes to talk, they can download the ShoutCast Radio Distributed Network Audio Software (DNAS), install it on an Internet connected server and begin broadcasting. Once installed, the radio host only needs to drop the music files into the appropriate folder and the streaming begins. ShoutCast DNAS defaults to tcp/8000 but can be configured to use any port. The DNAS software can also act as a relay, sending and receiving other radio stations. Because DNAS is installed on a freely available Internet connection and is accessible by tcp/80 (or other port), it is conceivable that an employee, taking advantage of high speed networking at work, can stream music to the world. Further exemplifying the interconnected nature of the Internet is the fact that listeners can access ShoutCast-based radio stations using Pandora, iTunes (Mac), or WinAmp (Windows). </analysis>

                    <description>Shutterfly is an Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service. Founded in 1999, Shutterfly, Inc. provides products and services that make it convenient for consumers to preserve their digital photos in a creative manner. Shutterfly's flagship product is its Photo Book line for self-publishing photobooks. The Company has more than several billion images stored in its digital archive. One of the co-founders of Shutterfly was James H. Clark.

Shutterfly offers free photo storage and does not forcibly delete user images. Shutterfly also now has an arrangement with Target Stores to enable you to print and pickup photos there.

In August 2008, Shutterfly introduced Shutterfly Share sites. The new tools allows users to create public Web pages from their photos stored on Shutterfly. Like other social networking sites, users can invite others to view their Shutterfly Share sites that include comment forums, photo books and links to YouTube videos. Shutterfly also plans to allow users to post photos on blogs or social networks in late 2008.

On April 8th, Shutterfly introduced Shutterfly for iPhone, a free photo sharing iPhone App that gives customers the power to upload, view and share their Shutterfly photos while on-the-go. (http://www.shutterfly.com/free-photo-sharing-iPhone-app)
The Shutterfly iPhone App allows customers mobile access to view their Shutterfly albums on their iPhone. Photos taken on the iPhone can be uploaded to the customer’s Shutterfly account and stored for free, at full resolution. Additionally, users can create a new Shutterfly account directly from their iPhone.

Shutterfly’s iPhone App automatically uploads photos to a registered Shutterfly account, and allows customers to instantly post photos to their personalized Shutterfly Share site for friends and family to see.</description>

                    <description>Sky Player (formerly known as 'Sky Anytime on PC' and 'Sky By Broadband') was launched in January 2006. The service allows customers to download video onto their PC through a broadband internet connection. As of November 2009 the software also allows the live streaming of selected Sky TV channels. The VoD content comprises sport highlights, news, feature-length movies and TV programmes. This content is allowed to be viewed for a limited number of days and is protected by digital rights management software provided by Microsoft, and therefore cannot be copied to disc or played after the date carried by the licence. The service is available at no extra cost to Sky TV customers with accessible content matching subscribed TV channels (some content require additional payment on a pay-per-view basis). Other users can access by subscribing to Sky Player or on a pay-per-view basis.

This service was temporarily suspended after the release of a FairUse4WM, a program which can remove said DRM protection. The service resumed on 16 October 2006, with users being informed of the change by email.

On 25 November 2006, Sky announced the rebranding of Sky By Broadband as Sky Anytime on PC. Sky also released an upgrade for the Sky By Broadband client which included a rebranded interface and a new Pay-Per-View service which includes movies and US television shows.

On 16 May 2008, Sky rebranded the software again, changing the name to Sky Player and the updated software to included live simulcasts of Sky News and Sky Sports.</description>

                    <description>Windows Live SkyDrive (initially Windows Live Folders) is part of Microsoft's Windows Live range of online services. SkyDrive is a file storage and sharing service that allows users to upload files to the computing cloud, then access them from a web browser. It uses Windows Live ID to control access to the user's files, allowing them to keep the files private, share with contacts, or make the files public. Publicly-shared files do not require a Windows Live ID to access.

The service currently offers 25 GB of free personal storage, with individual files limited to 50 MB. Optionally, an ActiveX-based tool can be installed to allow drag-and-drop uploading from Windows Explorer. Up to five files can be uploaded each time if the tool has not been installed.</description>

                    <description>Skype is a proprietary Voice over IP service and software application. Skype was first released in 2003 written by Estonian developers Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and Jaan Tallinn, who had also originally developed Kazaa. It developed into a platform with over 600 million users and was bought by Microsoft in 2011. The service allows users to communicate with peers by voice using a microphone, video by using a webcam, and instant messaging over the Internet. Unlike most other VoIP services, Skype is a hybrid peer-to-peer and client–server system. It makes use of background processing on computers running Skype software. Skype's original proposed name (Sky Peer-to-Peer) reflects this fact.

On November 6, 2012, Microsoft announced that Windows Live Messenger will be retired (except in mainland China) in favor of Skype. The function allowing users to merge their Skype accounts with Microsoft account was introduced, allowing them to communicate with their Messenger contacts via the Skype clients. Microsoft will begin the transition for all users from April 8, 2013.</description>
                    <analysis>	Skype is best known as a peer-to-peer IP telephony application developed by Niklas Zennstrm and Janus Friis, also founders of the file sharing application Kazaa and the new peer-to-peer television application Joost.  Skype compliments and competes directly with existing phone services, from traditional POTS to VoIP services.  Skype, as an IP Phone, has gained high popularity in a very short period of time, boasting 100 million registered users in less than 4 years of deployment. Its major strengths include the ability to provide connectivity through firewalls and NAT (network address translation), support for a large number of active users, and privacy protection via the use of strong encryption. Moreover, it supports integrated instant messaging (IM), chat, file transfer, video conferencing, and a global directory which makes it a very competitive option to  other IM clients. Skype was acquired by EBay in 2005 and continues to improve their technology and increase market growth.


Skype's underlying technology leverages a distributed peer-to-peer architecture to route multimedia packets among the users as opposed to centralized servers. The peer-to-peer network offers increased connectivity and scalability, and also provides firewall traversal and dynamic routing to evade corporate firewalls.  Despite the fact that it's a closed-source application based on proprietary protocols, Skype seems to be winning customers based on the strength of providing low-cost and good-quality VOIP services.  However, the proprietary and evasive behavior of Skype indeed poses a security challenge to enterprise networks, particularly given its ability to transfer files and information without visibility or control.

                    <description>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet-standard protocol for managing devices on IP networks. Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks, and more. It is used mostly in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention. SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). </description>

Devices that typically support SNMP include routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, modem racks, and more. SNMP is used by network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention.

This identifies version 3 of the protocol. SNMPv3 provides important security features: Confidentiality - Encryption of packets to prevent snooping by an unauthorized source; Integrity - Message integrity to ensure that a packet has not been tampered with in transit including an optional packet replay protection mechanism; Authentication - to verify that the message is from a valid source.</description>

                    <description>Soribada is the first Korean peer-to-peer system. It started service in 2000. Soribada has been referred to as ""the Korean Napster"" and means ""Ocean of Sound"" or ""Receiving Sound"". Soribada was closed in 2002 by court order of Judge Kim Sun-Hye. After this, the program is still being distributed by Soribada, under the utility stipulations that they are not responsible for any of the files. After the trial, on November 5th, 2003, Soribada was reborn with the new name, Soribada . On July, 2004, the Soribada website was renewed to become a P2P search portal. It also opened its paid MP3# service in December 2004. Now they have also released the programs Soribadaman, and Filebada. Soribada is still the most widely-used P2P system in Korea.</description>

                    <description>The SOS online backup service is delivered through a software program (the SOS Windows Client) installed on the end-user's computer. The user then tells the program what files to protect, and each night, at a configured time, (or instantaneously at the option of the user) SOS backs up any files that have changed since the previous backup. Files are backed up to a global network of SOS datacenters. </description>

                    <description>Spotify is a proprietary peer-to-peer streaming music program that allows instant listening to specific tracks or albums with almost no buffering delay. Music can be browsed by artists, albums or created playlists as well as by direct searches. Although it is not possible to save the streamed music for use outside the application, a link is provided to allow the listener to directly purchase the material via partner retailers. </description>

                    <description>SquirrelMail is a web-based email application started by Nathan and Luke Ehresman and written in the PHP scripting language. It can be installed on almost all web servers as long as PHP is present and the web server has access to an IMAP and SMTP server.

SquirrelMail outputs valid HTML 4.0 for its presentation, making it compatible with a majority of current web browsers. SquirrelMail uses a plugin architecture to accommodate additional features around the core application.

                    <description>Secure Shell is a set of standards and an associated network protocol that allows establishing a secure channel between a local and a remote computer.</description>
                    <analysis>SSH is commonly used by IT to establish a protected connection to another corporate machine for purposes of remote management. SSH has been known to be used by knowledgeable end-users to access their home machines (or other machines) and use those remote machines for non-work related activities. To be fair, SSH is a commonly-used IT tool and it is difficult to determine how it is being used in every organization. With SSH, a user can easily bypass existing controls in an encrypted tunnel. </analysis>

                    <description>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols which provide secure communications on the Internet for such things as web browsing, e-mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging and other data transfers.</description>
                    <analysis>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a protocol designed to provide encryption with minimal to no configuration.  SSL is virtually synonymous with TLS (Transport Layer Security) with most people simply referring to SSL/TLS as SSL. Unlike many other types of encryption, SSL is optimized for applications where only one side of the connection is authenticated.  Combined with ubiquitous support in all browsers, it is the standard for providing confidentiality and authentication for HTTP traffic also referred to as HTTPS (HTTP over SSL).  Given its ease of use and pervasive support, SSL has become the foundation of many other applications, such as SSL VPN solutions, web conferencing applications, and even some P2P applications.  
&amp;lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;br/&gt;
SSL technology, with the help of a third-party certificate authority (CA), provides a full suite of cryptographic protections - confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and sender non-repudiation. Integrity, authentication and non-repudiation protections use public-key based (asymmetric) cryptographic algorithms like RSA and DSA, along with secure hash algorithms like MD5 and SHA1.  Confidentiality protection uses secret-key based (symmetric) cryptographic algorithms like DES, 3DES, RC4, and AES. 
&amp;lt;br/&gt;
&amp;lt;br/&gt;

The most critical challenge associated with SSL is the visibility into what runs inside the SSL encryption.  Nearly all networks allow SSL to traverse the network without knowing what applications, files, data, or malicious content might be inside.  As it is increasingly used as the basis of a network applications tools for evading detection and control by network security devices, it is important to regain visibility and control.  Enterprises have every reason to want to maintain good visibility to what these applications are in order to enforce safe usage policies and mitigate risks therein.</analysis>

                    <description>The Internet Stream Protocol (ST) was an experimental protocol defined in 1979 in IEN 119 (Internet Engineering Note), and was later revised in RFC 1190 (ST2) and RFC 1819 (ST2+). ST was envisioned to be the connection oriented complement to IPv4, but it has never been introduced for public usage. Many of the concepts available in ST can be found today in MPLS.</description>

The RShare network as well as the network protocol were developed by Lars Regensburger with strong anonymity, security and acceptable download rates in mind. All traffic in the RShare network is routed through other nodes in the network. Furthermore, traffic is encrypted with point-to-point encryption. In combination this two techniques provide a very high level of anonymity.</description>

                    <description>Synergy is a software application for sharing a keyboard and mouse between multiple computers. It is used in situations where several PCs are used together, with a monitor connected to each, but are to be controlled by one user. The user needs only one keyboard and mouse on the desk - similar to a KVM switch without the Video.

                    <description>Syslog is a standard for logging program messages . It allows separation of the software that generates messages from the system that stores them and the software that reports and analyzes them. It also provides devices, which would otherwise be unable to communicate, a means to notify administrators of problems or performance.

Syslog is can be used for computer system management and security auditing as well a generalized informational, analysis and debugging messages. It is supported by a wide variety of devices (like printers and routers) and receivers across multiple platforms. Because of this, syslog can be used to integrate log data from many different types of systems into a central repository.

Messages refer to a facility ( auth, authpriv, daemon, cron , ftp, lpr, kern, mail, news, syslog, user, uucp, local0, ... , local7 ) and are assigned a priority/level ( Emergency, Alert, Critical, Error, Warning, Notice, Info or Debug) by the sender of the message.

Configuration allows directing messages to various local devices (console), files (/var/log/) or remote syslog deamons. Care must be taken when updating the configuration as omitting or misdirecting message facility.level can cause important messages to be ignored by syslog or overlooked by the administrator.

logger is a command line utility that can send messages to the syslog.

Some implementations permit the filtering and display of syslog messages.

Syslog is now standardized within the Syslog working group of the IETF.</description>

                    <description>TACACS+ is based on TACACS, but, in spite of its name, it is an entirely new protocol which is incompatible with any previous version of TACACS. TACACS+ and RADIUS have generally replaced the earlier protocols in more recently built or updated networks, although TACACS and XTACACS are still running on many older systems.</description>

                    <description>Telex is a new approach to resisting state-level Internet censorship. Rather than attempting to win the cat-and-mouse game of finding open proxies, Telex leverages censors’ unwillingness to completely block day-to-day Internet access. In effect, Telex converts innocuous, unblocked websites into proxies, without their explicit collaboration. It envisions that friendly ISPs would deploy Telex stations on paths between censors’ networks and popular, uncensored Internet destinations. Telex stations would monitor seemingly innocuous flows for a special “tag” and transparently divert them to a forbidden website or service instead.</description>

                    <description>Teredo is a tunneling protocol designed to grant IPv6 connectivity
	 to nodes that are located behind IPv6-unaware NAT devices. It defines a way
	 of encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4 UDP datagrams that can be routed
	 through NAT devices and on the IPv4 internet.</description>

                    <description>Timbuktu is a remote control software product developed by Motorola. Remote control software allows a user to control another computer across the local network or the Internet, viewing its screen and using its keyboard and mouse as if he or she were sitting in front of it. Timbuktu is compatible with computers running both Mac OS X and Windows.

Timbuktu was first developed in the late 1980s as a Macintosh product by Farallon Computing and a version was later developed to run on Microsoft Windows. Farallon was renamed Netopia in 1999 and the company was acquired by Motorola in February 2007. Timbuktu is currently the only commercial non-VNC-based remote control software which has both a server and client running on both platforms (the open-source Virtual Network Computing protocol also has implementations on both platforms, from separate vendors). Timbuktu's primary function is remote control, and the application has support for various remote-control features such as multiple displays, screen-scaling, remote screen lockout and keyboard lockout, clipboard synchronization and "on the fly" color-depth reduction for enhanced speed.

In addition to the remote control features (screen-sharing), Timbuktu also allows for file transfers, system profiling, voice and text chat, and remote activity notifications. Timbuktu versions 5.1 and earlier initiate connections over UDP port 407, though versions 5.2 and later use TCP port 407. The program has integrated support for Secure Shell (ssh) tunneling for those who require additional security. Both the Mac and Windows versions can use a standalone user database or integrate with the respective platform's "standard" user database (OpenDirectory on the Mac, and Active Directory or NT Users on Windows). The 8.6 version, released in March of 2006, added an optional integration with Skype to enable a user to remote-control any of their Skype contacts who have Timbuktu installed. The 8.6 Mac version is also a Universal Binary supporting both Intel and PowerPC-based Macs. The 8.7 version, released in October 2007, added support for Mac OS X v10.5.</description>

                    <description>Tor (short for The Onion Router)  is a system intended to enable online anonymity. Tor client software directs internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers to conceal a user's location or usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace Internet activity, including "visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages and other communication forms", back to the user and is intended to protect users' personal freedom, privacy, and ability to conduct confidential business by keeping their internet activities from being monitored.
"Onion Routing" refers to the layered nature of the encryption service: The original data are encrypted and re-encrypted multiple times, then sent through successive Tor relays, each one of which decrypts a "layer" of encryption before passing the data on to the next relay and, ultimately, its destination. This reduces the possibility of the original data being unscrambled or understood in transit.  
The Tor client is free software and use of the Tor network is free of charge.</description>

                    <description>OfficeScan is a multi-threat prevention solution to protect networks from malware, network viruses, web-based threats, spyware, and mixed threat attacks. The product is designed as a single solution to protect desktops, laptops, servers, storage appliances, and smartphones. It is actually a suite of applications (with optional plug-ins), with a client application residing at the endpoint and a server program that manages all clients. The client guards the endpoint and reports its security status to the server. This means that even a large enterprise network of differing client types – including mobile devices – can be managed from a single web-based console. Architecturally, the product is based on Trend Micro’s Smart Protection Network, a cloudclient infrastructure, resulting in a lighter-weight client. The aim here is twofold – to reduce the reliance on conventional pattern downloads and to eliminate the delays commonly associated with desktop updates. The stated benefits include increased network bandwidth, reduced CPU utilisation and the associated cost savings that go with this approach.

                    <description>Trippy is a free, web and mobile social travel tool. Trippy aims to simplify and improve travel planning through what they call "friend-sourcing." The app ties into users' social networks, such as Facebook, to discover which friends, family and contacts have visited the considered destination -- whether it be that they’ve checked-in, lived, worked, or studied there. Through one-click recommendations and Facebook-style commenting, Trippy lets friends suggest what hotels, restaurants, and destinations would be a good fit. Users can then add places they’re considering so that friends can comment on the itinerary, offering feedback in Facebook-style comment feeds.</description>

                    <description>Tudou is one of the largest video sharing websites in China, where users can upload, view and share video clips. Tudou went live on April 15, 2005 and by September 2007, served over 55 million videos each day.

Tudou states they are one of the world's largest bandwidth users, moving more than 1 Petabyte per day to 7 million users. YouTube does serve a larger number of videos per day, but since the average Tudou video is longer in duration, the total amount of minutes of video being streamed daily from Tudou is significantly larger - about 15 billion minutes vs. 3 billion for YouTube.

Tudou is becoming popular with users in the west because it allows the viewer to watch entire episodes of television shows and movies, rather than being restricted to short 10 minute clips as with YouTube.

The Shanghai-based service uses Adobe Flash technology to publish more than 20,000 new videos each day, including amateur content such as videoblogging and original videos, movie and TV clips, and music videos. Unregistered users can watch videos on the site, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos, using on-line and Windows-based upload tools.</description>

                    <description>Tuenti is a Madrid-based, invite-only private social networking website that has been referred to as the "Spanish Facebook." Tuenti, pronounced in Spanish, sounds like Twenty in English. The name, however, actually comes from "tu enti[dad]," meaning "your entity." The site is targeted at the Spanish audience, and is currently accessible only to those who have been invited.

Tuenti features many tools common to social-networking sites. It allows users to set up a profile, upload photos, link videos and connect with friends. Many other utilities, such as the ability to create events, are also offered. Unlike similar social networking sites which feature banner advertisements, Tuenti has opted out of these traditional forms of "noisy" and obstructive advertising

                    <description>TVU Networks Corporation is an Internet company that operates an Internet television broadcasting network that uses P2PTV technology to offer its broadcasters global reach and low costs. Founded in 2005, the company is based in Mountain View, California.

Users download a free software application for Windows called TVUPlayer and can then watch several dozen TV channels over the internet; as of November 2007 these include the Sci Fi Channel, Spike TV, Fox News, Fox Soccer Channel, GolTV and several of the Chinese CCTV channels.

Some of these stations (mostly smaller ones) are placed on the service legally; however, many of these channels are pirated.</description>

                    <description>text-based posts of up to 140 characters displayed on the author's profile page and delivered to the author's subscribers who are known as followers. Senders can restrict delivery to those in their circle of friends or, by default, allow open access. Users can send and receive tweets via the Twitter website, Short Message Service (SMS) or external applications. While the service itself costs nothing to use, accessing it through SMS may incur phone service provider fees.

The 140 character limit on message length was initially set for compatibility with SMS messaging, and has brought to the web the kind of shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140 character limit has also spurred the usage of URL shortening services such as tinyurl, bit.ly and tr.im, and content hosting services, such as Twitpic and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters.

Since its creation in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Twitter has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It is sometimes described as the "SMS of the Internet" since the use of Twitter's application programming interface for sending and receiving short text messages by other applications often eclipses the direct use of Twitter.

What we have to do is deliver to people the best and freshest most relevant information possible. We think of Twitter as it's not a social network, but it's an information network. It tells people what they care about as it is happening in the world.
—Evan Williams 

Twitter is ranked as one of the 50 most popular websites worldwide by Alexa's web traffic analysis. Although estimates of the number of daily users vary because the company does not release the number of active accounts, a February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits. In March 2009, a Nielsen.com blog ranked Twitter as the fastest-growing site in the Member Communities category for February 2009. Twitter had a monthly growth of 1,382 percent, Zimbio of 240 percent, followed by Facebook with an increase of 228 percent. However, only 40 percent of Twitter's users are retained.</description>

                    <description>Unreal is a first-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and Digital Extremes and published by GT Interactive (now owned by Atari) in May 1998. It was powered by an original gameplay and computer engine that now bears the game's name, one that had been in development for over three years in founder Tim Sweeney's garage before the game was released.
Since the release of Unreal, the franchise has had one sequel and two different series based on the Unreal universe. One official bonus pack, the Fusion Map Pack released by Epic Games, can be downloaded from the internet for free.</description>

                    <description>Ustream.tv, established March 2007, is a website which consists of network of diverse channels providing a platform for lifecasting and live video streaming of events online. The website has over 320,000 registered users who generate 350,000+ hours of live streamed content per month with over ten million unique hits per month. It received $11.1 million in Series A funding for new product development from DCM and investors Labrador Ventures and Band of Angels.

During the 2008 United States presidential election, the website was used by nearly all the main candidates to help their campaign, by allowing a larger amount of voters to ask political questions. Former Senator and 2008 Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel became the first candidate ever to stream an alternate debate on Ustream.tv that allowed Sen. Gravel to respond to all of the questions being asked, as well as comment on the responses from the other candidates throughout a nationally televised debate.</description>

                    <description>Vakaka provides video on demand and live streaming via P2P for free. Ding tells us, “Unlike Joost or Babelgum, Vakaka X-TV provides VOD and live streaming at the same time. So you can both view a VOD film from Vakaka X-TV and a real-time concert scene. Vakaka X-TV has a Joost-like UI, including channel zone, widget zone, playing control zone, and setting zone.”</description>

                    <description>VMware View provides remote desktop capabilities to users using VMware's virtualization technology. With VMware View the desktop components are “decoupled” from physical devices and delivered as a managed service from a centralized location such as the datacenter or from the cloud. End-users can connect to their desktops, applications and data from multiple devices and across any network connection. By centrally managing the desktops, applications and user data in the data center, organizations benefit from improved manageability and control while end-users benefit from flexible access and improved levels of service. It supports both RDP and PCoIP protocols for display.</description>

                    <description>In computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the RFB protocol to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.

VNC is platform-independent - a VNC viewer on one operating system may connect to a VNC server on the same or any other operating system. There are clients and servers for many GUI-based operating systems and for Java. Multiple clients may connect to a VNC server at the same time. Popular uses for this technology include remote technical support and accessing files on one's work computer from one's home computer, or vice versa.

VNC was originally developed at the Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. The original VNC source code and many modern derivatives are open source under the GNU General Public License.</description>

                    <description>This App-ID can be used to identify and control file-transfer activity on VNC. Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the RFB protocol to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.

VNC is platform-independent – a VNC viewer on one operating system may connect to a VNC server on the same or any other operating system. There are clients and servers for many GUI-based operating systems and for Java. Multiple clients may connect to a VNC server at the same time. Popular uses for this technology include remote technical support and accessing files on one's work computer from one's home computer, or vice versa.

VNC was originally developed at the Olivetti Research Laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. The original VNC source code and many modern derivatives are open source under the GNU General Public License.</description>

                    <description>Virtual Native Network is a Chinese Server-less and peer to peer VPN software based on NAT traversal (RFC-3489). VNN is useful for the users in different branch offices to use their LAN based applications across the Internet without requiring them to reconfigure their routers or firewalls. They can run the applications just as they are on the local area network. When users with VNN software running on their PCs, based on VNN's virtualized LAN, the users will see a new subnet IP address on their PC. Each user's PC will be given a fixed host name, in the form of userid.groupid.vnn, so they can run their applications based on this fixed hostname, no matter where the PC is and no matter what IP address the PC gets.</description>

                    <description>Voddler is a commercial video-on-demand service and accompanying client application distributing movies and television programming using a patented hybrid peer-to-peer  distribution system.

Voddler's concept is similar to those of Amazon Video on Demand, Vudu, Headweb, Spotify, and Grooveshark, but only for video, and with its client software's 10-foot user interface is primarily designed for the living-room TV instead of a desktop computer interface, much like the graphical user interface of Boxee. The service in its advertisement-financed version is currently only available in parts of western Europe during the ongoing beta phase, although the subscription model should in the future be available in almost all countries.</description>

                    <description>Vtunnel is a CGI proxy service that allows users to connect through it to evade website blocking by schools, corporations, or governments, to access websites that would normally be blocked. It can also be done to provide anonymity, so that the website you are visiting does not know who you are.

                    <description>Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP) is a Cisco-developed content-routing protocol that provides a mechanism to redirect traffic flows in real-time. It has built-in load balancing, scaling, fault tolerance, and service-assurance (failsafe) mechanisms. Cisco IOS Release 12.1 and later releases allow the use of either Version 1 (WCCPv1) or Version 2 (WCCPv2) of the protocol.</description>

                    <description>Web Browsing is using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is a method used to transfer or convey information on the World Wide Web. Its original purpose was to provide a way to publish and retrieve HTML pages. </description>
                    <analysis>Web browsing continues to evolve.  Initially used to simply view HTML formatted information, web browsers have become the client, through which, users can access new applications that provide functionality far beyond simple information browsing. These applications include web mail, instant messaging, streaming media, web conferencing, blogs, file sharing and other social networking
applications.  Much of the plain web-browsing activities has effectively been overshadowed by all the other applications.

One of the most significant characteristics of web browsing is that applications can be embedded within the web browsing framework, known as HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Applications embed or "tunnel" within HTTP for various reasons, like ease-of-use through the browser interface, anywhere accessibility, ability to bypass the corporate firewall, and ubiquitous connectivity through HTTP ports. What this does is increasing the complexity of managing legitimate or unwanted tunneled applications, and providing a means for malware to evade detection. These applications pose serious challenges to the enforcement of access policies and mitigation of other threats.

                    <description>Wetpaint is a free wiki hosting service (or wiki farm) founded in October 2005. All wiki URLs are a subdomain of "wetpaint.com". Wetpaint targets non-technical internet users who want to collaborate online, and therefore attempts to include easy to use features, such as a three step wiki creation wizard. In March 2008, Wetpaint added social networking features. Wetpaint is free of charge and supported by contextual advertising. Established educational sites are ad-free upon request.</description>

                    <description>WiiConnect24 is a feature of the Wii console first announced at E3 2006 by Nintendo. It enables you to remain connected to the Internet while the console is in stand-by. For example, a friend might be able to visit another player's Wii town and leave that player messages in Animal Crossing without him or her being present. WiiConnect24 is sometimes confused with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, which is used to provide online gameplay over Nintendo's servers. Online gameplay titles for the Wii are able to make use of both the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service and WiiConnect24.</description>

                    <description>Windows Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure, created by Microsoft, for building, deploying and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. It provides both platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) services and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. Windows Azure is Microsoft's competing product to Amazon's AWS cloud computing platform, Google App Engine, and other systems.</description>

                    <description>WinMX is a freeware peer-to-peer file sharing program authored by Frontcode Technologies that runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems, created in 2001. According to one study, it was the number one source for online music in 2005 with an estimated 2.1 million users. Frontcode itself abandoned development of WinMX in September 2005, but a community of developers brought the service back online within a few days by releasing patches or new host files. In North America, WinMX has since been eclipsed by other networks such as Gnutella and BitTorrent, but it remains one of the most popular p2p clients in Japan with over 3 million estimated users as of 2006.</description>

                    <description>Winny (also known as WinNY) is a Japanese peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing program which claims to be loosely inspired by the design principles behind the Freenet network, which keep user identities untraceable. While Freenet was implemented in Java, Winny was implemented as a Windows C++ application.

The software takes its name from WinMX, where the M and the X are raised one letter in the Latin alphabet, to N and Y. According to a 2006 report by the Recording Industry Association of Japan, upwards of three million people had tried Winny, and it has alternated with WinMX as the most popular file-sharing program in Japan.

Like Freenet, each client functions as a node. Initially, a search will return few results, but one can set up "clusters" based on certain keywords, and over time, your client will learn the best route to obtain the information sought.

                    <description>Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is Microsoft's implementation of NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) on Windows, a name server and service for NetBIOS computer names. Effectively, WINS is to NetBIOS names, what DNS is to domain names - a central mapping of host names to network addresses. However, the mappings are dynamically updated (e.g. at workstation boot), so that when a client needs to contact another computer on the network it can get its up-to-date DHCP-allocated address.</description>

                    <description>In the X Window System, an X display manager runs as a program, allowing starting a session on an X server from the same or another computer. The X Display Manager Control Protocol uses UDP port 177. An X server requests that a display manager start a session by sending a Query packet. If the display manager allows access for that X server, it responds by sending a Willing packet back to the X server.</description>

                    <description>Yahoo! 360° is a personal communication portal operated by Yahoo!. It is similar to other social networking sites and while text on the site still describes it as being in beta testing, in fact development has ended and the site is no longer actively supported. Long after support ended, the promised replacement social network site has never materialized.

360° includes social networking, blogging, and photo sharing services.

Users can create personal web sites, share photos from Yahoo! Photos, maintain blogs, lists of local reviews, supply profile information, and see which friends are currently online. 360° also, by default, features a 'friends updates' section, under which each friend's latest update is summarized (e.g. blog posts, updates lists, new photostream etc.).</description>

                    <description>Yandex (Russian: Я́ндекс) is a Russian search engine and one of the largest Russian Web portals. Yandex was launched in 1997. Its name can be explained as "Yet Another iNDEXer" (yandex) or "Языково́й (language) Index". The Russian word "Я" corresponds to English "I" (as the singular first-person pronoun), making "Яndex" a bilingual pun on "index."</description>

                    <description>Yoics is a network solution that transforms any computer or network attached device instantly into an easily accessible and shareable internet resource. With an intuitive user interface, remote access and sharing is about as easy as using instant messaging.</description>
                    <analysis>Yoics! is a client/server application that falls into the remote desktop access category. It uses port 80 or can hop from port to port (dynamic). Remote desktop access tools can be invaluable for IT support personnel. However, Yoics is not targeted at the IT professional – it is targeted at the end-user (consumer) as a means of accessing or sharing computing resources. From their website: 

“Yoics is a powerful network solution that transforms any computer or network attached device instantly into an easily accessible and shareable internet resource. Featuring an intuitive user interface, remote access and sharing has just gotten as easy as using instant messaging.”

Yoics! uses VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to enable device sharing with other users. VNC is not a very secure tool so Yoics! sets up a secure connection between the two peers which is encrypted with a new random 160bit key for each connection established. Over that secure connection, a user can share their desktop, a folder, or a camera. Using the Yoics! NOW proxy, a user can also access internal network resources. 

While Yoics! is a client/server application, yoics.net allows users to access their machine through a web browser. When using Yoics.net, the connection is tunneled over SSL to simplify remote, browser-based access to desktop resources. Yoics! uses SSL because it always works, even behind high security corporate firewalls. And it works with no software installed on the host computer. So if a user is at a friend’s house, they won’t need to install Yoics! to remotely access their desktop – they can just go to Yoics.net and access it. </analysis>

                    <description>Zabbix is a network management system available as free software under GNU General Public License. Zabbix offers several monitoring options. Simple checks can verify the availability and responsiveness of standard services such as SMTP or HTTP without installing any software on the monitored host. A Zabbix agent can also be installed on UNIX and Windows hosts to monitor statistics such as CPU load, network utilization, disk space, etc. As an alternative to installing an agent on hosts, Zabbix includes support for monitoring via SNMP, TCP and ICMP checks, IPMI and custom parameters. Zabbix supports a variety of real-time notification mechanisms, including XMPP.</description>

                    <description>Zango, formerly 180solutions and Hotbar, produces software that provides access to partners' games and DRM-restricted videos and software. Zango software is listed as adware by Symantec. McAfee states, "this program may have legitimate uses", but describes it as a "potentially unwanted program", and an "adware downloader".

Zango's consumer website asserts that the company is "committed to creating a content economy built on a foundation of safe and ethical practices by protecting consumer privacy while offering a fulfilling and high-value content experience." Zango content includes sports, comedy, dance, erotic videos, online games, and screensavers. Warner Bros. and others have been known to provide content, although Warner Bros. has terminated its business relationship with Zango after concerns were raised that children viewing Warner Bros. content could be exposed to advertisements for pornography.

                    <description>Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) is a groupware product created by Zimbra Inc., located in San Mateo, California, USA. The company was bought by Yahoo! in September 2007. The software consists of both client and server components. Two versions of Zimbra are available: an open-source version, and a commercially supported version ("Zimbra Network") with closed-source components.

The ZCS Web Client is a full-featured collaboration suite that supports email and group calendars using an Ajax web interface that enables tool tips, draggable items, and right-click menus in the UI. Also included are advanced searching capabilities and date relations (e.g. hover over the phrase "tomorrow at 6:00 PM" in an email message and the system will display any appointments at that time). Online document authoring, "Zimlet" mashups and a full administration UI are also included. It is written using the Zimbra Ajax Toolkit.

The ZCS Server uses several open source projects (see the section, Included open source projects). It exposes a SOAP application programming interface to all its functionality and also is an IMAP and POP3 server. The server runs on many distributions of Linux as well as on Mac OS X.

ZCS is compatible with proprietary clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Apple Mail as well as the open-source Novell Evolution, so that mail, contacts, and calendar items can be synchronised from these to the ZCS server. Zimbra also provides native two-way sync to many mobile devices (Nokia Eseries, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile).</description>

                    <description>One of the most recent Zoho tools, Zoho Meeting is a web conference application that allows participants to see the web conference. The current version requires the creator of the conference to be using Microsoft Windows, but participants can use any operating system. Zoho Meeting allows participants to see the screen of the presenter by using either ActiveX, Flash, or Java. Zoho Show and Zoho Chat are integrated into the meeting, and participants can choose to control the desktop of the presenter. The Meeting Viewer can even be embedded in a separate webpage or a slide from Zoho Show. Zoho Meeting is currently free in public beta and offers live support.</description>

                    <description>Zoho Notebook is a powerful application that enables the creation of content from many different types of media. It is somewhat similar to Microsoft OneNote or Google Notebook, but includes greater support for multimedia content. Users may include text, images, video, and audio in a "notebook," and then share the notebook or individual pages with their friends. Zoho Notebook even allows integration of documents, full-fledged applications, and content via RSS. The content from the notebook may be uploaded or gathered from the web by using the Zoho Notebook plugin for Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer.</description>

                    <description>Zoho Sheet is the name of the spreadsheet application in the Zoho Office Suite. With the exception of running macros (a task no online spreadsheets handle) it supports most standard spreadsheet functions, and adds a few innovative twists, including auto-processing external data feeds (RSS/ATOM), and the ability to publish charts into blogs or other websites. Like Writer, it facilitates real-time collaboration, and it integrates well with other app's like Zoho Notebook or Creator. Zoho Sheet has a plugin to integrate with Microsoft Excel and is available both as a desktop widget and as part of online services such as box.net and Facebook.</description>

                    <description>Zoho Show, the online presentation program allows users to create presentations from scratch or (as is often the case) import from their library of Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt, .pps) or OpenOffice (.odp, .sxi) presentations. The resulting online presentation can be shared, played as slideshow, collaborated upon, and be embedded in blogs or websites. Zoho Show is one of the products that sets Zoho Office Suite apart from its competitors, most of which do not have a similar slideshow product.</description>

                    <description>ZumoDrive is a cloud-based file synchronization and storage service operated by Zecter, Inc. On December 22nd, 2010, Zecter announced its acquisition by Motorola Mobility. The service enables users to store and sync files online and between computers using their HybridCloud storage solution. ZumoDrive has a cross-platform client (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and Palm webOS) that enables users to copy any file or folder into the ZumoDrive virtual disk that is then synced to the web and the users' other computers and handheld devices. Files in the ZumoDrive virtual disk may then be shared with other ZumoDrive users or accessed from the web. Users may also upload files manually through a web browser interface. A free ZumoDrive account offers 2 GB of storage, and users may upgrade to paid plans ranging from 10 GB to 500 GB for a monthly subscription fee. The ZumoDrive service is also integrated into Yahoo! Mail allowing users to send or receive any file on their ZumoDrive, and powers HP's recent CloudDrive technology, bundled on all new HP Mini netbooks.</description>
